A school with an annual budget of £300,000 asks for its March instalment 10 months earlier in May. Assuming that the current interest rate applicable to funds invested with the Council is 3% then, the interest charge on that advance will be calculated as:</p>\n<p>(annual budget / 12) x (number of days in advance / 365) x (current interest rate + 2%) = interest charge</p>\n<p>(£300,000 / 12 = £25,000) x (305 / 365 = £20,890) x (3% + 2%) = £1,045</p>\n<h3>Annex C &#8211; Requirement to provide data on teacher pensions</h3>\n<p>In order to ensure that the performance of the duty on Reading Borough Council to supply Teachers Pensions with information under the Teachers&#8217; Pensions Regulations 1997, the following conditions are imposed on RBC and governing bodies of all maintained schools covered by this Scheme in relation to their budget shares.</p>\n<p>The conditions only apply to governing bodies of maintained schools that have not entered into an arrangement with Reading Borough Council to provide payroll services.</p>\n<p>A governing body of any maintained school, whether or not the employer of the teachers at such a school, which has entered into any arrangement or agreement with a person other than the Authority to provide payroll services, shall ensure that any such arrangement or agreement is varied to require that person to supply salary, service and pensions data to the Authority which the Authority requires to submit its annual return of salary and service to Teachers&#8217; Pensions and to produce its audited contributions certificate. The Authority will advise schools each year of the timing, format and specification of the information required. A governing body shall also ensure that any such arrangement or agreement is varied to require that Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) are passed to RBC within the time limit specified in the AVC scheme. The governing body shall meet any consequential costs from the school&#8217;s budget share.</p>\n<p>A governing body of any maintained school which directly administers its payroll shall supply salary, service and pensions data to RBC which the Authority requires to submit its annual return of salary and service to Teachers&#8217; Pensions and to produce its audited contributions certificate. Reading Borough Council will advise schools each year of the timing, format and specification of the information required from each school. A governing body shall also ensure that Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) are passed to the Authority within the time limit specified in the AVC scheme. The governing body shall meet any consequential costs from the school&#8217;s budget share.</p>\n<h3>Annex D &#8211; Responsibility for redundancy and early retirement costs</h3>\n<p>This guidance note summarises the position relating to the charging of voluntary early retirement and redundancy costs. It sets out what is specified in legislation and provides some examples of when it might be appropriate to charge an individual school&#8217;s budget, the central Schools Budget or the local authority&#8217;s non-schools budget.</p>\n<p>Section 37 of the 2002 Education Act says:</p>\n<p>(4) costs incurred by the local education authority in respect of any premature retirement of a member of the staff of a maintained school shall be met from the school&#8217;s budget share for one or more financial years except in so far as the authority agree with the governing body in writing (whether before or after the retirement occurs) that they shall not be so met<br />\n(5) costs incurred by the local education authority in respect of the dismissal, or for the purpose of securing the resignation, of any member of the staff of a maintained school shall not be met from the school&#8217;s budget share for any financial year except in so far as the authority have good reason for deducting those costs, or any part of those costs, from that share.<br />\n(6) The fact that the authority have a policy precluding dismissal of their employees by reason of redundancy is not to be regarded as a good reason for the purposes of subsection (5); and in this subsection the reference to dismissal by reason of redundancy shall be read in accordance with section 139 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18).</p>\n<p>The default position, therefore, is that premature retirement costs must be charged to the school&#8217;s delegated budget, while redundancy costs must be charged to the local authority&#8217;s budget. In the former case, the local authority has to agree otherwise for costs to be centrally funded, while in the latter case, there has to be a good reason for it not to be centrally funded, and that cannot include having a no redundancy policy. Ultimately, it would be for the courts to decide what was a good reason, but the examples set out below indicate the situations in which exceptions to the default position might be taken.</p>\n<h4>Charge of dismissal/resignation costs to delegated school budget</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If a school has decided to offer more generous terms than the authority&#8217;s policy, then it would be reasonable to charge the excess to the school</li>\n<li>If a school is otherwise acting outside the local authority&#8217;s policy</li>\n<li>Where the school is making staffing reductions which the local authority does not believe are necessary to either set a balanced budget or meet the conditions of a licensed deficit</li>\n<li>Where staffing reductions arise from a deficit caused by factors within the school&#8217;s control</li>\n<li>Where the school has excess surplus balances and no agreed plan to use these</li>\n<li>Where a school has refused to engage with the local authority&#8217;s redeployment policy</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Charge of premature retirement costs to local authority non-schools budget</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a school has a long-term reduction in pupil numbers and charging such costs to their budget would impact on standards</li>\n<li>Where a school is closing, does not have sufficient balances to cover the costs and where the central Schools Budget does not have capacity to absorb the deficit</li>\n<li>Where charging such costs to the school&#8217;s budget would prevent the school from complying with a requirement to recover a licensed deficit within the agreed timescale</li>\n<li>Where a school is in special measures, does not have excess balances and employment of the relevant staff is being/has been terminated as a result of local authority or government intervention to improve standards</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Costs of early retirements or redundancies may only be charged to the central part of the Schools Budget where the expenditure is to be incurred as a result of decisions made before 1st April 2013. Costs may not exceed the amount budgeted in the previous financial year.</p>\n<p>It is important that the local authority discusses its policy with its Schools Forum. Although each case should be considered on its merits, this should be within an agreed framework. It may be reasonable to share costs in some cases, and some authorities operate a panel to adjudicate on applications.<br />\nA de-delegated contingency could be provided, if Schools&#8217; Forum agree, to support individual schools where &#8220;a governing body has incurred expenditure which it would be unreasonable to expect them to meet from the school&#8217;s budget share&#8221;.</p>\n<p>For staff employed under the community facilities power, the default position is that any costs must be met by the governing body, and can be funded from the school&#8217;s delegated budget if the governing body is satisfied that this will not interfere to a significant extent with the performance of any duties imposed on them by the Education Acts, including the requirement to conduct the school with a view to promoting high standards of educational achievement. Section 37 now states:</p>\n<p>(7)Where a local education authority incur costs—<br />\n(a)in respect of any premature retirement of any member of the staff of a maintained school who is employed for community purposes, or<br />\n(b)in respect of the dismissal, or for the purpose of securing the resignation, of any member of the staff of a maintained school who is employed for those purposes,<br />\nthey shall recover those costs from the governing body except in so far as the authority agree with the governing body in writing (whether before or after the retirement, dismissal or resignation occurs) that they shall not be so recoverable.<br />\n(7A)Any amount payable by virtue of subsection (7) by the governing body of a maintained school to the local education authority may be met by the governing body out of the school&#8217;s budget share for any funding period if and to the extent that the condition in subsection (7B) is met.<br />\n(7B) The condition is that the governing body are satisfied that meeting the amount out of the school&#8217;s budget share will not to a significant extent interfere with the performance of any duty imposed on them by section 21(2) or by any other provision of the Education Acts.<br />\n(8)Where a person is employed partly for community purposes and partly for other purposes, any payment or costs in respect of that person is to be apportioned between the two purposes; and the preceding provisions of this section shall apply separately to each part of the payment or costs.</p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Community facilities</h2>\n<h3>13.1 Application of Schemes for Financing Schools to the Community Facilities Power</h3>\n<p>Schools which choose to exercise the power conferred by s.27 (1) of the Education Act 2002 to provide community facilities will be subject to controls. Regulations made under s.28 (2), if made, can specify activities which may not be undertaken at all under the main enabling power. Section 88 of the Children and Families Act 2014 has removed the requirements in section 28(4) and section 28(5) of the Education Act 2002 for maintained schools in England. Under section 28(4) a school was obliged to consult its Authority and under section 28(5) a school must have regard to advice or guidance from the Secretary of State or their local authority when offering this type of provision.</p>\n<p>Under s.28(1), the main limitations and restrictions on the power will be those contained in the maintaining authority&#8217;s scheme for financing schools made under section 48 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 as amended by paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 to the Education Act 2002. This amendment extended the coverage of schemes to include the exercise of the powers of governing bodies to provide community facilities.</p>\n<p>Schools are therefore subject to prohibitions, restrictions and limitations in the scheme for financing schools.</p>\n<p>This part of the scheme does not extend to joint-use agreements; transfer of control agreements, or agreements between the authority and schools to secure the provision of adult and community learning.</p>\n<h3>13.2 Consultation with the authority &#8211; financial aspects</h3>\n<p>Schools no longer need to consult the Authority when establishing community facilities. Nor do they have to have regard to advice given to them by their authority. However, as public bodies, they are expected to act reasonably, and this includes consulting those affected by decisions they make.</p>\n<h3>13.3 Funding agreements &#8211; authority powers</h3>\n<p>Schools seeking to enter into any funding agreement with a third party either supplying funding or supplying funding and taking part in the provision, must submit any such proposed agreement to the Director of Education for comment. Schools must give the Authority a minimum of 4 weeks response time in such consultation.</p>\n<p>Schools seeking Authority advice and submitting proposals to the Authority for comment must take into account the comments of the Authority and inform the Authority what action has been taken following Authority advice. Whilst the Authority has no right of veto for such agreements, if an agreement has been or is to be concluded against the wishes of the Authority, or as been concluded without informing the Authority, which in the view of the Authority is seriously prejudicial to the interests of the school or the Authority, that may constitute grounds for suspension of the right to a delegated budget.</p>\n<h3>13.4 Other prohibitions, restrictions and limitations</h3>\n<p>In cases where the Authority considers that a proposed project carries significant financial risks to the Authority, it may require the governing body concerned to make arrangements to protect the financial interests of the Authority by either carrying out the activity concerned through the vehicle of a limited company formed for the purpose, or by obtaining indemnity insurance for risks associated with the project as specified by the Authority.</p>\n<p>13.5 Supply of financial information to the Authority</p>\n<p>Schools which exercise the community facilities power should provide the Authority every six months with a summary statement showing the income and expenditure for the school arising from the facilities in question for the previous six months and on an estimated basis, for the next six months.</p>\n<p>Should the Authority consider there to be cause for concern as to the school&#8217;s management of the financial consequences of the exercise of the community facilities power, it may request financial statements every three months and the submission of a recovery plan for the activity in question if required.</p>\n<p>Financial information relating to community facilities must be included in returns made by schools under the CFR framework. Schedule 15 of the act provides that mismanagement of funds spent or received for community facilities is a basis for suspension of the right to delegation of the budget share.</p>\n<h3>13.6 Audit</h3>\n<p>Schools, in concluding funding agreements with other persons pursuant to the exercise of the community facilities power, should ensure that such agreements contain adequate provision for access by the Authority to the records and other property of those persons held on the school premises, or held elsewhere insofar as they relate to the activity in question, in order for the Authority to satisfy itself as to the propriety of expenditure on the facilities in question.</p>\n<h3>13.7 Treatment of income and surpluses</h3>\n<p>Schools may retain all net income derived from community facilities except where otherwise agreed with a funding provider.</p>\n<p>Schools may carry such retained net income over from one financial year to the next as a separate community facility supply, or transfer all or part of it to the budget share balance.</p>\n<p>If the school is a community or community special school and the Authority ceases to maintain the school, any accumulated retained income obtained from exercise of the community facilities power reverts to the Authority.</p>\n<h3>13.8 Health and safety</h3>\n<p>The health and safety provisions of the main scheme (see section 11.5) also apply to the community facilities power.</p>\n<p>The governing body will be responsible for the costs of securing Disclosure and Barring Service clearance, where appropriate for all adults involved in community activities taking place during the school day.</p>\n<h3>13.9 Insurance</h3>\n<p>It is the responsibility of the governing body to ensure adequate arrangements are made for insurance against risks arising from the exercise of the community facilities power. The school should seek the Authority&#8217;s advice before finalising any insurance arrangement for community facilities and should allow a two week response time for the Authority. The Authority may undertake its own assessment of the insurance arrangements made by a school in respect of community facilities and if it judges those arrangements to be inadequate, make arrangements itself and charge the resultant cost to the school.</p>\n<h3>13.10 Taxation</h3>\n<p>Schools should seek the advice of the Authority initially and the local VAT office or professional VAT advice on any issues relating to the possible imposition of Value Added Tax on income and expenditure in connection with community facilities and any company set up to manage such facilities.</p>\n<p>Schools must fulfil the Authority&#8217;s directions on VAT issues that impact on the Authority&#8217;s VAT return or position.</p>\n<p>If any member of staff employed by the school or Authority in connection with community facilities at the school is paid from funds held in a school&#8217;s own back account, the school is likely to be held liable for payment of income tax and National Insurance, in line with HM Revenue and Customs rules.</p>\n<p>Schools should follow Authority advice in relation to the Construction Industry Scheme where this is relevant to the exercise of community facilities power.</p>\n<h3>13.11 Banking</h3>\n<p>Schools should either maintain separate bank accounts for budget share and community facilities, or have one account but with adequate internal accounting controls to maintain separation of funds. School should also have regard to the provisions at 3.5 and 3.6 above relating to the banks which may be used, signing of cheques, the titles of bank accounts, the contents of bank account mandates, and similar matters. The general approach to these matters should mirror these sections, except that a provision requiring that a mandate show the LA as owner of the funds in the account should exempt the community facilities funds from that if they are not in the same account as the budget share.</p>\n<p>Schools must not borrow money to fund a community service without the written consent of the Secretary of State (<a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/article/12005/Section-3-Instalments-of-the-budget-share-banking-arrangements\">see section 3.7</a>).</p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<h3>11.1 Right of access to information</h3>\n<p>Governing bodies are required to supply upon request and within a reasonable timescale, all financial and other information including the specific requirements outlined throughout this document, which might reasonably be required to enable the Authority or, its auditors to satisfy itself as to the school&#8217;s management of its delegated budget share, or the use made of any central expenditure by the Authority (e.g. earmarked funds) on the school.</p>\n<h3>11.2 Liability of governors</h3>\n<p>Under the terms of s.50 (7) of the Act, and the governing body being a corporate body, governors of maintained schools will not incur personal liability in the exercise of their power to spend the delegated budget share provided they act reasonably in good faith.</p>\n<h3>11.3 Governors&#8217; expenses</h3>\n<p>Under schedule 50(5) of the Act, only allowances in respect of purposes specified in regulations may be paid to governors from a school&#8217;s delegated budget share. Payment of any other allowances is forbidden. Schools are also barred from payment of expenses which duplicate those paid by the Secretary of State to additional governors appointed by him to schools under special measures.</p>\n<h3>11.4 Responsibility for legal costs</h3>\n<p>Where the governing body fails to act in accordance with the advice of the Authority, then the Authority is authorised to charge school&#8217;s budget shares for appropriate legal costs incurred by the school&#8217;s governing body. The Authority will wherever possible discuss in advance with schools its intention to make such a charge, and may in exceptional circumstances, following consultation with schools, waiver this right. The costs referred to are those of legal actions, including costs awarded against the authority, not the cost of legal advice provided.</p>\n<p>The Head of Legal Services will issue from time to time guidance to schools about procedures for obtaining legal advice, including circumstances where there is a conflict of interest between the governing body and the Authority.</p>\n<h3>11.5 Health and Safety</h3>\n<p>The Authority, governors, senior managers and all employees have general duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Those duties are underpinned by more specific requirements set out in regulations or other legislation. In expending the school&#8217;s budget share, governing bodies are required to give due regard to the requirements as specified in the aforementioned as well as those incorporated in Authority policy and other guidelines issued by the Authority that are deemed to be applicable to schools.</p>\n<h3>11.6 Right of attendance for the Chief Finance Officer</h3>\n<p>Governing bodies are required to permit the Chief Finance Officer or any person nominated by the Chief Finance Officer to attend meetings of the governing body at which any agenda items are relevant to the exercise of her or his responsibilities. To facilitate this, the Authority will, unless this is impracticable, give prior notice of its intention to attend, and the governing body will supply upon request advance details including appropriate documentation of specific items to be discussed at such meetings.</p>\n<p>Relevant items are those relating to financial probity, or overall financial management of the Authority. Schools will always advise the Chief Finance Officer if the Governing Body is considering a probity matter where there is an allegation of fraud or irregularity in the use of delegated or devolved funds.</p>\n<h3>11.7 Special Educational Needs</h3>\n<p>Schools are required to use their best endeavours in spending the budget share, to secure the special educational needs of their pupils. If the LA is advised that this is not being achieved it may need to suspend delegation where a situation is serious enough to warrant it.</p>\n<h3>11.8 Interest on late payments</h3>\n<p>Schools are reminded that the terms of the scheme cannot affect statutory requirements. The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 requires debts to suppliers to be paid within 30 days of receiving the goods/services, or receiving the invoice (whichever is the later). The supplier must receive a cheque or cleared funds by the 30th day. Suppliers are entitled to charge interest at Bank of England Base rate plus 8% on late payments, as well as reasonable debt recovery costs.</p>\n<h3>11.9 &#8216;Whistleblowing&#8217;</h3>\n<p>The purpose of the <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/whistleblowing\">whistleblowing policy</a> is to encourage all staff to feel confident in raising serious concerns, to question and act upon concerns about practice; to provide a method of raising concerns and receiving feedback on any action taken; to ensure that a response to concerns is received and to reassure staff that you will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistleblowing in good faith. This scheme should be followed by persons working at a school or school governors who wish to complain about financial management or financial propriety at the school.</p>\n<p>As a first step, concerns should normally be raised with your immediate manager or Chair of the Board of Governors. This depends, however, on the seriousness and sensitivity of the issues involved and who is thought to be involved in the malpractice. If you need advice and guidance on how matters of concern may be pursued the Chief Auditor at Reading BC should be contacted.</p>\n<h3>11.10 Child Protection</h3>\n<p>Schools must release staff to attend child protection case conferences and other related events.</p>\n<h3>11.11 Redundancy/Early Retirement Costs (new)</h3>\n<p>The 2002 Education Act sets out how premature retirement and redundancy costs should normally be funded. Reading has its own local arrangements and it is expected that schools will normally meet all redundancy/early retirement costs from their delegated budgets, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>Annex D sets out the statutory guidance on the funding of premature retirement and redundancy costs.</p>\n",

In addition, individual teachers or Governors may unwittingly open themselves to the possibility of being sued personally. The Chief Finance Officer can determine the minimum levels of insurance cover for Schools. The Minimum Requirement will be based on the cover currently provided by the LA, or such amounts that the Chief Finance Officer reasonably determines due to changes in the nature of the risk. Schools will not be allowed to place their insurance cover elsewhere unless they can demonstrate that these meet the Minimum Requirements.</p>\n<p>When considering the options open to them Governing Bodies should make their decision bearing in mind their own individual circumstances and ensure that they are clear as to the extent of cover and other services included within each option.</p>\n<p>In the event of the School deciding not to take advantage of the Council&#8217;s Insurance Service, the School must demonstrate that it has arranged cover to as good a standard as that which would have been arranged by the LA.</p>\n<p>Schools making their own alternative insurance arrangements must produce evidence of such insurance to the Chief Finance Officer following inception and each subsequent annual renewal.

Schools&#8217; Forum will decide whether any schools will be required to provide additional information regarding the proposed use of those balances, if it has concerns over that school&#8217;s financial management. Schools&#8217; Forum may commission the Authority to collect the information or collect the information directly. Schools&#8217; Forum must make information so collected available to the Authority on request.</p>\n<h3>4.3 Interest on surplus balances</h3>\n<p>Balances held by the Authority on behalf of schools will not attract interest.</p>\n<h3>4.4 Obligation to carry forward deficit balances</h3>\n<p>Where a schools expenditure in a financial year exceeds the schools budget share plus any surplus/deficit balances carried forward from a previous year, this will generate a deficit balance to be carried forward to the next financial year. Any such deficit balances will form a first charge and be deducted from the following year&#8217;s budget share.</p>\n<p>Unless the deficit is very small and can be managed within the school&#8217;s normal cash flow, as soon as the school foresees such a situation is likely to arise it must seek advice of the Chief Finance Officer and Director of Education with proposals as to how the situation will be addressed.</p>\n<p>Details of the amount of balances carried forward from one financial year to the next will be reflected in the relevant out-turn statement published under s.251.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"4.5\"></a></p>\n<p>4.5 Planning for deficit budgets</h3>\n<p>Schools are required to operate on the basis of a balanced budget agreed with the Authority and are not permitted to plan for deficits in their initial budget plan. In the event that a school unavoidably generates a deficit balance then section 4.9 of the scheme shall apply.</p>\n<h3>4.6 Charging of interest on budget advances</h3>\n<p>The Authority is permitted to charge interest on any cash advanced to fund deficit balances. Interest on deficit balances will be calculated on a daily basis and may be charged at a rate up to base rate plus 2% though this will normally be waived provided the Authority has agreed the business plan to address a deficit position.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>4.7 Writing off deficits</h3>\n<p>The Authority is not permitted to write off the deficit balance of any school.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>4.8 Balances of closing and replacement schools</h3>\n<p>When a school closes, any balance, whether surplus or deficit shall revert to the Authority; it cannot be transferred as a balance to any other school, even where the school is a successor to the closing school. The closing school must make all reasonable endeavours to avoid a deficit balance on closure.</p>\n<p>The Authority may make allocations to new schools which have the effect of giving them the benefit of additional sums which are equal to the balances of the relevant closing schools.</p>\n<p>Where a school converts to academy status (whether as a standalone academy or as part of a multi academy trust) under section 4(1)(a) of the Academies Act 2010, the Authority must pay to the new academy school an amount equal to the surplus balance of the school at the date of conversion.</p>\n<p>Where a school with a deficit balance converts to academy status (whether as a standalone academy or as part of a multi academy trust) under section 4(1)(a) of the Academies Act 2010, the Authority shall be compensated by central government for the amount of deficit inherited at the date of conversion.

Where a school with a deficit balance converts to academy status as a sponsored academy due to being eligible for intervention, the amount of the deficit is transferred to the Authority. The Authority may charge some or all of the cost of deficit against the Dedicated Schools Grant.</p>\n<h3>4.9 Planned (licensed) deficits</h3>\n<p>The LA will permit schools to plan for a deficit budget in particular circumstances. The funding to allow such a deficit budget shall be provided from the collective surplus of school balances held by the authority on behalf of schools although it is open to the local authority, in circumstances where there is no such surplus, to make alternative arrangements if it can do so within the relevant local authority finance legislation.</p>\n<p>The requirements are set out below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The maximum length over which schools may repay the deficit, i.e. reach at least a zero balance with appropriate mechanism to ensure that the deficit is not simply extended indefinitely, would normally be five years.</li>\n<li>The deficit will only be agreed to allow a school in the short term to maintain a level of spend which in the opinion of the Head of the Education Service is the minimum required to deliver the National Curriculum.</li>\n<li>The maximum size of the deficit in normal circumstances will not exceed 5% of the school&#8217;s budget share.</li>\n<li>The maximum proportion of the collective balances held by the LA, which would be used to back the arrangement, shall not exceed 20%.</li>\n<li>Before a deficit budget is approved, the school must produce a detailed deficit recovery plan in the prescribed format for the duration of the planned period of the deficit, which will be reviewed and updated at least annually.</li>\n<li>The school must provide to the local authority any additional information/school data requested in relation to the deficit recovery within a reasonable timescale. This may include information on staffing structures, class/timetable arrangements, curriculum plans etc.</li>\n<li>The school must submit monthly budget monitoring reports to the local authority.</li>\n<li>The school must meet with the local authority at least every 6 months to review progress of the deficit recovery plan and attend Schools&#8217; Forum if requested.</li>\n<li>A member of the LA may attend the school&#8217;s Governor Meetings where the budget is to be discussed.</li>\n<li>The Head of the Education Service, jointly with the Chief Finance Officer, would be responsible for approving any deficit.</li>\n<li>Should a school not comply with the requirements of the licensed deficit, and/or the deficit recovery plan is not being adhered to, the authority may issue a Notice of Concern (see paragraph 2.21) which may ultimately result in withdrawal of financial delegation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Local Authority will inform schools annually on the guidelines to setting a deficit budget and any additional requirements in operating with a licensed deficit.</p>\n<p>Schools with an approved licenced deficit may request a budget advance to meet a deficit balance where cash flow problems are experienced until the situation can be corrected and the deficit removed.</p>\n<h3>4.10 Loan Schemes</h3>\n<p>Loans must only be used to assist schools in spreading the cost over more than one year of large one-off individual items of a capital nature that have a benefit to the school lasting more than one financial or academic year. Loans cannot be used as a means of funding a deficit that has arisen because a school&#8217;s recurrent costs exceed its current income.</p>\n<p>There is currently no loan scheme available to Reading Borough Council Schools, and schools with a deficit are covered by a licenced deficit as set out in paragraph 4.9.</p>\n<h3>4.11 Credit union approach</h3>\n<p>Schools may group together to utilise externally held balances for a credit union approach to loans.

    "content": "<h2>Instalments of the budget share; banking arrangements</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this section, Budget Share includes any place-led funding for special schools or pupil referral units.</p>\n<h3>3.1 Frequency of instalments</h3>\n<p>The Authority will ensure that schools receive their budget share allocation in monthly instalments sufficient to meet their reasonable cash-flow needs. Top-up payments for pupils with high needs will be made on a monthly basis unless alternative arrangements have been agreed with the provider. The Chief Finance Officer in consultation with the Director of Education will agree with individual schools an appropriate schedule of payment. Payments to individual school bank accounts will usually be by BACS.</p>\n<h3>3.2 Proportion of budget share payable at each instalment</h3>\n<p>Monthly budget share payments to schools will be made in accordance with the schedule of payment agreed with individual schools and the Chief Finance Officer. Where no prior agreement exists with a school and the Chief Finance Officer, then the budget share payable will be equal to one twelfth of the schools approved budget share. Payment will be made direct into the school&#8217;s main bank account.</p>\n<p>Schools wishing to revise their schedule of payment, changing either the frequency of each instalment or the proportion of budget share payable at each instalment are required to submit their request at least two weeks in advance in writing to the Chief Finance Officer.</p>\n<p>Schools who use a payroll service that is external to that provided by the Authority will receive their budget share in instalments that reasonably take account of payroll costs. Those schools whose payroll is administered by the Authority will receive the instalments net of estimated payroll costs for the period to which the payment relates.</p>\n<h3>3.3 Interest clawback</h3>\n<p>Where a school requests and the Authority agrees to make available the budget share in advance (of what the Authority believes to be reasonable cash flow needs taking account of the pattern of expenditure of schools of that size, and any particular representations relating to the individual school&#8217;s circumstances) the Authority may deduct from the budget share an amount equal to the estimated interest lost. The calculation basis as outlined in annex B (Interest charges on advances) may be at a rate up to 2% higher than the rate applicable to funds invested with the Authority on any amount advanced, although provided the Authority has agreed the business plan with the school that sets out the repayment regime, interest will usually be waived.</p>\n<h4>3.3.1 Interest on late budget share payments</h4>\n<p>The Authority will add interest to late payments of budget share instalments made after payroll run day each month, where such late payment is the result of Authority error. The interest rate to be used will be that used for clawback calculations as detailed above.</p>\n<h3>3.4 Budget shares for closing schools</h3>\n<p>Subject the agreement of the Director of Education and the Chief Finance Officer, the budget shares of schools for which approval for discontinuation has been secured, may be made available until closure of that school on a monthly basis net of estimated pay costs, even where some different basis was previously used.</p>\n<h3>3.5 Bank and building society accounts</h3>\n<p>All maintained schools must establish a main bank account to which the budget share will be paid. They must notify the Chief Finance Officer of the account and any proposals to change it. Schools shall be allowed to retain all interest payable on the account unless they choose to have an account within an authority contract which makes other provision.</p>\n<p>When a school so changes its bank account, the previous account used to receive budget shares should be closed within 3 months, and any balance transferred to the new account. Any balance the Authority is holding in respect of the school&#8217;s budget share (or if necessary an estimate, to be adjusted once the correct amount is determined), will also be transferred to the new account (or from it in the case of a deficit, subject to funds being available).</p>\n<p>Schools shall also notify the Chief Finance Officer of other bank accounts they hold, although this is not necessary if the account is held by a separate legally constituted related legal body (e.g. a properly constituted charitable trust).</p>\n<p>The operation of school bank accounts in this way will result in school balances being held in the nominated account at the year end, or one otherwise agreed with the Chief Finance Officer (subject to adjustments associated with estimated payroll costs, as mentioned in 3.2.).</p>\n<h3>3.6 Restrictions on accounts</h3>\n<p>Full details, including account details and authorised signatories (minimum of two) for all banking transactions, of all bank and/or building societies maintained by the school should be supplied in writing to the Chief Finance Officer. Schools are normally required to advise the Authority at least three months in advance of its intention to change its banking arrangement. Any school closing an account used to receive its budget share and opening another must agree the new bank or building society with the Chief Finance Officer, which must be consistent with the authority&#8217;s Treasury Management policy.</p>\n<p>Under section 49(5) of the Act, all monies paid by the Authority and held in such accounts shall remain to be the property of the Authority until spent.</p>\n<p>Although accounts can be in the name of the school rather than the authority, wherever the school holds its bank account, the account mandate should provide that the Authority is the owner of the funds in the account, that it is entitled to receive statements, and that it can take control of the account if the school&#8217;s right to a delegated budget is suspended by the Authority.</p>\n<p>Where on-line banking is used, schools must ensure that sufficient controls are in place for authorisation of transactions.</p>\n<h3>3.7 Borrowing by schools</h3>\n<p>With the exception of loan schemes run by the Authority and outlined in the scheme, Governing Bodies may only borrow money (which includes the use of finance leases) with the written permission of the Secretary of State (who will only grant permission for borrowing in exceptional circumstances). Details of all such requests and subsequent approvals or otherwise should be supplied in writing to the Authority&#8217;s Chief Finance Officer.</p>\n<p>However, schools may be permitted to use any scheme that the Secretary of State has said is available to schools without specific approval, such as the Salix scheme which is designed to support energy saving.</p>\n<p>Schools must not use interest bearing credit cards, as this is considered a form of borrowing. Procurement cards should be used for facilitating electronic purchases, and these must be set up to prevent cash withdrawals. Balances must be fully cleared on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>The restrictions do not apply to Trustees and Foundations, whose borrowing, as private bodies, makes no impact on government accounts, though such borrowing must not be serviced directly from the delegated budget.</p>\n<h3>3.8 Finance leases and hire purchase agreements</h3>\n<p>The Authority adopts the definition of leases in accordance with best accounting practice as described in the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17.</p>\n<p>IAS 17 classifies a lease as a finance lease if it &#8216;transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership&#8217; to the lessee. A lease not classified as a finance lease is classified as an operating lease.</p>\n<p>A finance lease is a form of borrowing and must not be entered into by a school without the agreement of the Authority. A hire purchase agreement is similar in substance to a finance lease and must not be entered into by a school.</p>\n<p>IAS 17 states that &#8216;whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contract&#8217;.</p>\n<p>IAS gives the following examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease: &#8211;<br />\na) The lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.<br />\nb) The lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price which is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the date the option becomes exercisable such that, at the inception of the lease, it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.<br />\nc) The lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred.<br />\nd) At the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset.<br />\ne) The leased assets are of a specialised nature such that only the lessee can use them without major modifications being made.</p>\n<p>The standard also provides indicators of situations that individually or in combination could result in a finance lease as follows: &#8211;<br />\na) If the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor&#8217;s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee.<br />\nb) Gains and losses from the fluctuation in the fair value of the residual accrue to the lessee.<br />\nc) The lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially lower than market rent.</p>\n<p>Schools must seek an opinion from the Authority&#8217;s professional advisors (financial or legal) or the Authority before entering into any significant lease agreement, where a significant lease agreement is defined as a lease agreement where an annual gross lease payment to a bank or banks exceeds £20,000 or total gross lease payments over the life of the lease exceed £60,000 and/or at a level at the discretion of the Chief Finance Officer. This must be done irrespective of any advice given by the leasing company on the nature of the lease.</p>\n<p>Schools must not enter into a significant lease through the equipment vendor without the express agreement of the Authority.</p>\n<p>Schools must provide information on all leases as at the year-end or as requested by the Chief Finance Officer.</p>\n<h3>3.9 Other provisions</h3>\n<p>All relevant provisions contained in the Authority&#8217;s financial regulations or other appropriate financial guidance issued by the Authority shall be applicable to schools where those provisions impact on a school&#8217;s banking arrangements.</p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Financial controls</h2>\n<h3>2.1 Application of financial controls to schools</h3>\n<p>Schools are required to abide by the Authority&#8217;s requirements on financial controls and monitoring in the management of their delegated budgets as outlined within this scheme and detailed in the financial regulations, and also those guidelines contained in more detailed publications referred to in the scheme but outside and compatible with it.</p>\n<h3>2.2 Provision of financial information and reports</h3>\n<p>Schools are required to provide the Authority with details of actual expenditure and income reconciled to the bank account (I&amp;E Return) on a monthly basis. Schools will also be required to submit outturn statements twice a year &#8211; usually in October (monitoring position at month 6) and in January (monitoring position at month 9). The Authority may determine different methods for individual schools and will consult with schools about such requirements, for example schools in financial difficulty may be asked to submit monthly monitoring reports. The submission of such information should so far as possible take account of the Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) framework. This is in addition to the financial information required as part of schools annual budget plans and year-end predicted outturn processes.</p>\n<h3>2.3 Payment of salaries; payment of bills</h3>\n<p>All payments from delegated budgets are to be made in accordance with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any specific Service Level Agreement drawn up between the school and Reading Borough Council and,</li>\n<li>the guidelines as detailed as part of any service purchased by the school as part of a Buy-Back service from the Authority, which includes the retention of delegated funding as part of the arrangements for the payroll service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.4 Control of assets</h3>\n<p>Each school is required to maintain an inventory of its moveable assets, in a form to be agreed by the Authority and establish authorisation procedures for disposal of assets. As a minimum requirement all schools should maintain an inventory which records all plant, machinery and equipment with an estimated life of more than five years and an approximate replacement value of, or historic cost of more than, £1,000. Schools should also keep some form of register of assets worth less than £1,000 but are free to determine their own arrangements (with a suggested de minimis of £250). This would be to register anything that is portable and attractive such as a camera.</p>\n<h3>2.5 Accounting policies (including year-end procedures)</h3>\n<p>Schools are required to comply with the procedures, requirements and regulations relating to the accounting policies and end of year financial procedures issued and determined by the Authority as being applicable to schools. Guidance will be published annually on the practical arrangements (e.g. accruals accounting and other end of year financial procedures).</p>\n<h3>2.6 Writing off of debts</h3>\n<p>No debt shall be discharged other than by payment in full or being written off. The writing-off of non-recoverable debts is set out in the Financial Regulations and requires the Authority&#8217;s approval for sums over £5,000, as well as full Governing Body approval.</p>\n<h3>2.7 Basis of accounting</h3>\n<p>End of year reports and accounts completed by schools for submission to the Authority are to be prepared on the same accounting basis as the Authority&#8217;s financial accounts, that is on an accruals accounting basis, as detailed in the Authority&#8217;s financial regulations and in accordance with a timetable agreed with the Authority. Support will be available from the Authority for schools requiring assistance in this process.</p>\n<h3>2.8 Submission of budget plans</h3>\n<p>Governing bodies must prepare, formally adopt and submit to the Authority a budget plan which reconciles with their total budget allocation, detailing its budgeted income and expenditure for the current financial year, in a format taking account of the Consistent Financial Reporting framework. The plan should be prepared in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Authority to schools as part of the Authority&#8217;s annual budget preparation process, and should take full account of estimated deficits / surpluses at the previous 31 March. Governing bodies should normally submit their formal budget plan to the Authority by no later than 1 st May (for 2019 only this will be 31st May, though all schools are encouraged to submit earlier).</p>\n<p>The Authority will supply schools in a timely manner with all income and expenditure data it holds which is necessary to efficient planning by schools, for example indicative budget shares as soon as they are available, usually by the end of January.</p>\n<p>The Authority would normally expect the Governing body to review the initial submitted and approved budget plan in September and January of the current financial year and submit current year outturn forecasts to the Authority. Completed budget plans and any current year forecasts need to demonstrate both the assumptions which underpin the financial data reported and what consideration the school has made of other Authority initiatives which have a direct impact on the school&#8217;s resources.</p>\n<h3>2.9 Submission of financial forecasts</h3>\n<p>Governing bodies must also submit to the Chief Finance Officer a financial forecast covering each year of a three to five year period. The purposes of such forecasts are to ensure schools are planning ahead strategically and to indicate where schools may have financial difficulties. Multi-year forecasts should be submitted no later than the 30th June.</p>\n<h3>2.10 School Resource management</h3>\n<p>Schools must seek to achieve effective management of resources and value for money, to optimise the use of their resources, and to invest in teaching and learning, taking into account the Authority&#8217;s purchasing, tendering and contracting requirements.</p>\n<p>It is for heads and governors to determine at school level how to optimise the use of resources and maximise value for money.</p>\n<p>As a minimum schools should review their current expenditure, compare it to other schools (such as through use of the DfE&#8217;s benchmarking tool), and think about how to make improvements.</p>\n<h3>2.11 Virement</h3>\n<p>Governing bodies are authorised to freely transfer funds between budgets whilst ensuring that the overall budget as approved and submitted to the Authority remains within the cash limit agreed with the Authority. It is for the Governing Body to determine the extent to which it wishes to delegate power to vire between budget heads and to record its decision in the minutes of the Governing body. Proposed virements exceeding the delegated power must be formally adopted by the Governing Body and duly minuted.</p>\n<h3>2.12 Audit: General</h3>\n<p>In accordance with the Local Government Act 1972 and the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2011, the Chief Finance Officer has a statutory responsibility to ensure that a continuous internal audit and examination of accounting, stores and financial records and internal control systems of the Authority and its officers are carried out.</p>\n<p>The Chief Finance Officer or a nominated and authorised representative, including the Authority&#8217;s external auditor, shall have the authority to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>enter at all times on any premises or land used by the Authority;</li>\n<li>make such checks and seek such explanations as is considered necessary to be satisfied any matters under examination are correct;</li>\n<li>require any employee of the Authority and/or governing body to produce upon request cash, stores or other Authority (including all school) property under his/her control (including reasonable access to IT systems).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wherever possible auditors will agree an appointment in advance with the school and ensure that they carry out their duties with the minimum disruption to the school.</p>\n<p>This internal audit shall be carried out in accordance with the audit regime adopted by the Authority and as detailed in the Authority&#8217;s Financial Regulations. Schools must co-operate with the Chief Finance Officer or his / her representative in all aspects related to the internal and external audit process including responding promptly and where appropriate confidentially to requests for information necessary to carry out the audit.</p>\n<p>Head teachers and/or governing bodies shall notify the Director of Education, who shall in-turn inform the Chief Finance Officer of any irregularities or suspected irregularities concerning cash, stores or other property of the Authority or school, or the exercise of any of the Authority&#8217;s or school&#8217;s functions.</p>\n<h3>2.13 Separate external audits</h3>\n<p>Governing bodies are authorised to spend funds from their budget share to obtain external audit certification of its accounts, separate from any Authority internal or external audit process. Any external audit commissioned by the school must take into account the status of the school as being a spender of the Authority&#8217;s funds. Copies of external audit reports commissioned by the school should be made available to the Authority.</p>\n<h3>2.14 Voluntary Funds Charity Commission Registration and Audit of voluntary and private funds</h3>\n<h4>Registration</h4>\n<p>Charity Commission registration requirements should be followed, these differ between voluntary, foundation and community schools. Schools must consider their own specific needs should the annual gross income of these funds exceed £5,000. This includes donations, fund raising receipts as well as interest payments. Where the fund (or part of the fund) is used as a holding account, where money is being collected for a specific purpose, e.g. school trips, photographs, uniforms, this can be netted off and be exempt from the £5,000 (other than any surplus). If a school is in any doubt about whether or not it needs to register, it should seek advice from the Charity Commission.</p>\n<h4>Scrutiny of accounts</h4>\n<p>The Governing body must advise the Chief Finance Officer of all voluntary and private funds held by the school including any trading organisations controlled by the school. In addition to details of any such funds, schools are required to provide annual audit certificates of all such funds. The governing body must choose either independent examination by a suitably qualified person or arrange for an independent audit by a registered auditor that provides the level of assurance deemed suitable and this should be documented in the school&#8217;s own finance procedures manual.</p>\n<p>Any other requirements concerning the audit of such funds are a matter for those making the funds available and, where registered as a charity, any Charity Commission requirements.</p>\n<h3>2.15 Register of business interests</h3>\n<p>Governors and staff have a responsibility to avoid any conflict between their business and personal interests and the interests of the school. This is essential for effective and accountable financial management of the school. Interest should be declared that could result in a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>Examples of potential conflicts of interest include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Financial &#8211; interests in a contract or proposed contract by direct or family connection.</li>\n<li>Appointment &#8211; interests in the provision for sponsor governors or interests in someone&#8217;s appointment, reappointment or suspension from office as a governor or clerk to the governing body.</li>\n<li>Pay and performance &#8211; interests in the pay or appraisal of someone working at the school in cases where the governor or staff member is also paid to work at the school.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The governing body of each school is required to establish a register which lists for each member of the governing body and management team (including the head teacher and School Business Manager/Bursar), any business interests they or any member of their immediate family have; details of any other educational establishments that they govern; and any relationship between school staff and members of the governing body. The register must be kept up to date with notification of changes and through annual review of entries, and to make the register available for inspection by governors, staff and parents, and the authority and to publish the register on a publicly accessible website.</p>\n<h3>2.16 Purchasing, tendering and contracting requirements</h3>\n<p>Schools must abide by the Authority&#8217;s financial regulations and standing orders in purchasing, tendering and contracting matters (including leases). Schools are required to assess in advance, where relevant, the health and safety competence of contractors, taking account of the Authority&#8217;s policies and procedures.</p>\n<p>In accordance with DfE requirements, schools are exempt from any provisions in the Authority&#8217;s Financial Regulations which would require them to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>do anything incompatible with the provisions of the Scheme, or any statutory provision, or any EU Procurement Directive;</li>\n<li>seek an Authority officer countersignature for any contracts for goods or services for a value below £60,000 in any one year;</li>\n<li>select suppliers only from an approved list;</li>\n<li>permit schools to seek fewer than three quotes or tenders in respect of any contract with a value exceeding £10,000 in any one year, subject to specific listed exceptions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The fact that an authority contract has been let in accordance with EU procurement procedures does not in itself make it possible to bind a school into being part of that contract. For the purposes of the procurement directives schools are viewed as discrete units.</p>\n<p>Schools may seek advice on a range of compliant deals via <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-for-schools\">Buying for schools</a>.</p>\n<h3>2.17 Application of contracts to schools</h3>\n<p>Schools are free to elect to opt out of contracts arranged by the Authority.</p>\n<p>Whilst governing bodies are empowered under paragraph 3 of schedule 1 to the Education Act 2002 to enter into contracts, in most cases they do so on behalf of the Authority as maintainer of the school and the owner of the funds in the budget share. For this reason the Authority will require all contracts exceeding £100,000 entered into by the school to be countersigned by the Authority. Other contracts may be made solely on behalf of the governing body, when the governing body has clear statutory obligations &#8211; for example, contracts made by aided or foundation schools for the employment of staff. VA and Foundation school governing bodies are legally separate entities and do not require counter-signature from the Authority. However, as the Authority is providing the funds, any school which places a contract that will be funded by more than £60,000 from delegated funds, should advise the Authority. In practice this notification will normally happen in the ordinary course of events.</p>\n<p>In line with Section 2.16 and the requirement on schools to have regard to good tendering procedures, schools should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek tenders for all contracts over £60,000</li>\n<li>Obtain 3 quotes or tenders for contracts above £10,000</li>\n<li>Ensure that the Chair of Governors of all schools (or a nominee) opens tenders above £100,000</li>\n<li>Ensure that an Authority Member is involved in the opening of tenders above £250,000 (community schools only)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.18 Central funds and earmarking</h3>\n<p>The Authority is authorised to make sums available to schools from central funds, in the form of allocations which are additional to and separate from the schools&#8217; budget shares. All such allocations may be subject to conditions setting out the purpose or purposes for which the funds may be used; and while these conditions need not preclude virement (except, where the funding is supported by a specific grant which does not permit virement), this should not be carried to the point of assimilating the allocations into the school&#8217;s budget share.</p>\n<p>Such earmarked funding from centrally retained funds is only to be spent on the purposes for which it is given, or on other budget heads for which earmarked funding is given, and is not transferred into the budget share. Schools are not permitted to authorise expenditure in excess of the amount allocated without the prior agreement and approval of the Director of Education. Furthermore, unless previously agreed with the Director of Education, any earmarked funds not spent in the current financial year are to be returned to the Authority. The Authority will not make any deduction, in respect of interest costs to the Authority, from payments to schools of devolved specific special grant. Schools shall comply with the audit requirements as outlined within financial regulations. Details of earmarked funds as well as the purposes of such funds will be included with the budget statements for each school year.</p>\n<h3>2.19 Spending for the purposes of the school</h3>\n<p>Schools must be managed in accordance with their budget allocation for each financial year. They may use their budget allocation to meet, subject to the requirements as outlined in the scheme, all expenditure for the purposes of the school.</p>\n<p>They may not however use this resource to meet the cost of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any items detailed as exceptions within the scheme, and outlined in this document,</li>\n<li>any items relating to unofficial school funds and;</li>\n<li>any non-LA (or non-curriculum related) activities. By virtue of section 50(3A), amounts spent by governing bodies on community facilities under section 27 of the Education Act 2002 will be treated as if spent for the purposes of the school.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Schools are allowed to spend their budgets on pupils who are on the roll of other maintained schools or academies.</p>\n<p>Income received and/or reflected in the schools general accounts must come from the following sources only:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advances (general and special) from the Authority</li>\n<li>VAT, tax and other related reimbursements</li>\n<li>Any income generated as a result of an authorised school activity</li>\n<li>Approved contributions towards school expenditure from a third-party</li>\n<li>Any other sources as notified and agreed with the Director of Education and the Chief Finance Officer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.20 Capital spending from budget shares</h3>\n<p>Governing bodies may use their budget shares to meet the cost of capital expenditure on the school premises. This includes expenditure by the governing body of a voluntary aided school on work which is their responsibility under paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 of the SSAF Act 1998.</p>\n<p>Schools must notify the Authority of all proposed capital spending from their budget share. It is recommended that schools discuss their proposals with the Authority prior to the final authorisation of such proposals and in particular that they ensure that the proposed works do not already form part of the Authority&#8217;s approved capital programme. If the expected capital expenditure from the budget share in any one year will exceed £25,000, the governing body must notify the Authority and take into account any advice from the Director Education and the Chief Finance Officer as to the merits of the proposed expenditure. If the Authority owns the premises or the school has voluntary controlled status, then the governing body should seek the consent of the Authority to the proposed works, but consent will only normally be withheld on health and safety grounds.</p>\n<p>The reasons for these provisions is to help meet responsibilities with the School Premises (England) Regulations 2012, the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the Equality Act 2010, and the Building Regulations 2010.</p>\n<p>These provisions do not affect expenditure from any capital allocation made available by the authority outside the delegated budget share.</p>\n<h3>2.21 Notice of concern</h3>\n<p>The Authority may issue a notice of concern to the governing body of any school it maintains where, in the opinion of the Chief Finance Officer and the Director of Education, the school has failed to comply with any provisions of the scheme, or where actions need to be taken to safeguard the financial position of the Authority or the school.</p>\n<p>Such a notice will set out the reasons and evidence for it being made and may place on the governing body restrictions, limitations or prohibitions in relation to the management of funds delegated to it. These may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>insisting that relevant staff undertake appropriate training to address any identified weaknesses in the financial management of the school;</li>\n<li>insisting that an appropriately trained/qualified person chairs the finance committee of the governing body;</li>\n<li>placing more stringent restrictions or conditions on the day to day financial management of a school than the scheme requires for all schools &#8211; such as the provision of monthly accounts to the Authority;</li>\n<li>insisting on regular financial monitoring meetings at the school attended by Authority officers;</li>\n<li>requiring a governing body to buy into the Authority&#8217;s financial management systems; and</li>\n<li>imposing restrictions or limitations on the manner in which a school manages extended school activity funded from within its delegated budget share &#8211; for example by requiring a school to submit income projections and/or financial monitoring reports on such activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The notice will clearly state what these requirements are and the way in which and the time by which such requirements must be complied with in order for the notice to be withdrawn. It will also state the actions that the Authority may take where the governing body does not comply with the notice.</p>\n<h3>2.22 Schools Financial Value Standard (SFVS)</h3>\n<p>All local authority maintained schools (including nursery schools and Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) that have a delegated budget) must demonstrate compliance with the Schools Financial Value Standard (SFVS) and complete the assessment form on an annual basis. It is for the school to determine at what time in the year they wish to complete the form, but this must be before the end of the financial year.</p>\n<p>Governors must demonstrate compliance through the submission of the SFVS assessment form signed by the Chair of Governors. The form must include a summary of remedial action with a clear timetable, ensuring that each action has a specified deadline and an agreed owner. Governors must monitor the progress of these actions to ensure that all actions are cleared within specified deadlines.</p>\n<p>All maintained schools with a delegated budget must submit the form to the Authority before the 31st March.</p>\n<h3>2.23 Fraud</h3>\n<p>All schools must have a robust system of controls to safeguard themselves against fraudulent or improper use of public money and assets.</p>\n<p>The governing body and head teacher must inform all staff of school policies and procedures related to fraud and theft, the controls in place to prevent them; and the consequences of breaching these controls. This information must also be included in induction for new school staff and governors.</p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n<h3>1.1 The Funding Framework</h3>\n<p>The funding framework which replaces Local Management of Schools is set out in the legislative provisions in sections 45-53 of the School Standards and Framework (SSAF) Act 1998.</p>\n<p>Under this legislation, local authorities determine for themselves the size of their schools budget and their non-schools education budget &#8211; although at a minimum a local authority must appropriate its entire Dedicated Schools Grant to their schools budget. The categories of expenditure which fall within the two budgets are prescribed under regulations made by the Secretary of State, but included within the two, taken together, is all expenditure, direct and indirect, on an authority&#8217;s maintained schools<br />except for capital and certain miscellaneous items. Local authorities may centrally retain funding in their schools budget for purposes defined in regulations made by the Secretary of State under s.45A of the Act. The amounts to be retained centrally are decided by the authority concerned, subject to any limits or conditions prescribed by the Secretary of State (including gaining the approval of Schools&#8217; Forum or the Secretary of State in certain instances). The balance of the schools budget left after deduction of centrally retained funds is termed the Individual Schools Budget (ISB). Expenditure items in the non-schools education budget must be retained centrally (although earmarked allocations may be made to schools).</p>\n<p>Local authorities must distribute their ISB amongst their maintained schools using a formula which accords with regulations made by the Secretary of State, and enables the calculation of a budget share for each maintained school. This budget share is then delegated to the governing body of the school concerned, unless the school is a new school which has not yet received a delegated budget, or the right to a delegated budget has been suspended in accordance with s.51 of the Act. The financial controls within which delegation works are set out in a scheme made by the authority in accordance with s.48 of the Act and regulations made under that section. All proposals to revise the scheme must be approved by the Schools&#8217; Forum, though the authority may apply to the Secretary of State for approval in the event of the forum rejecting a proposal or approving it subject to modifications that are not acceptable to the authority.</p>\n<p>Subject to provisions of the scheme, governing bodies of schools may spend budget shares as they think fit for any purposes of their school. They may also spend budget shares on any additional purposes prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations made under s.50 of the Act. (Section 50 has<br />been amended to provide that amounts spent by a governing body on providing community facilities or services under section 27 of the Education Act 2002 are treated as if they were amounts spent for the purposes of the school).</p>\n<p>An authority may suspend a school&#8217;s right to a delegated budget if the provisions of the school financing scheme (or rules applied by the scheme) have been substantially or persistently breached, or if the budget share has not been managed satisfactorily. A school&#8217;s right to a delegated budget share may also be suspended for other reasons (schedule 17 of the Act).</p>\n<p>Each authority is obliged to publish each year a statement setting out details of its planned Schools Budget and other expenditure on children&#8217;s services, showing the amounts to be centrally retained and funding delegated to schools. After each financial year the authority must publish a statement showing outturn expenditure.</p>\n<p>The detailed publication requirements for financial statements are set out in directions issued by the Secretary of State. A copy of each year&#8217;s budget and outturn statement should be made easily accessible to all schools.</p>\n<p>Regulations also require a local authority to publish their scheme and any revisions to it on a website accessible to the general public, by the date that any revisions come into force, together with a statement that the revised scheme comes into force on that date.</p>\n<h3>1.2 The role of the scheme</h3>\n<p>The Scheme is prepared in line with the latest statutory guidance issued by the Department for Education which relates to s.48 of the School Standards and Framework Act, and Schedule 14 to the Act. It sets out the principles underlying the funding of schools, and the basis for the financial relationship between Reading Borough Council and the maintained schools which it funds. The requirements of the scheme relating to financial management and associated issues as detailed throughout this document are binding on both the Authority and on schools.</p>\n<h3>1.3 Application of the scheme to the Authority and maintained schools</h3>\n<p>The institutional coverage of the scheme will be for all community, nursery, voluntary, foundation, community special or foundation special schools and pupil referral units (PRUs) maintained by Reading Borough Council. A current list of the schools to which the scheme applies is provided at annex A (Schools covered by the scheme) of this document. Unless specifically stated otherwise the provisions of this Scheme apply to any nursery school maintained by the Authority. As indicated in s.48 of the Act, new maintained schools opening will also be covered by the scheme. Maintained schools that convert to academy status will cease to be covered by the Scheme. Similarly new Free Schools will not be covered by the Scheme.</p>\n<h3>1.4 Publication of the scheme</h3>\n<p>A copy of the scheme and any approved revisions will be supplied to the head teacher and to the governing body of each school covered by the scheme and placed on the Authority&#8217;s website. This requirement is subject to regulations published by the Secretary of State for Education.</p>\n<h3>1.5 Revision of the scheme</h3>\n<p>The scheme and any subsequent amendments are subject to the approval of members of Schools&#8217; Forum representing maintained schools. Any subsequent revisions to the scheme will be subject to consultation with the governing body and head teacher of every school maintained by the Authority and then submission to Schools&#8217; Forum for approval. Where Schools&#8217; Forum does not approve them or approves them subject to modifications which are not acceptable to the Authority, the Authority may apply to the Secretary of State for approval.</p>\n<p>If the Secretary of State makes directed revisions to schemes after consultation, such revisions become part of the scheme from the date of the direction.</p>\n<h3>1.6 Delegation of powers to the head teacher</h3>\n<p>As part of the scheme, the governing body of each school is required to consider and review (at a frequency to be determined by the governing body and agreed with the Director of Education) the extent to which it wishes to delegate its financial powers to the head teacher, and to record its decision (and any revisions) in the minutes of the governing body. Additionally, the Governing Body or a committee of the governing body must approve the first formal annual budget plan of each financial year.</p>\n<h3>1.7 Maintenance of Schools</h3>\n<p>Reading Borough Council is responsible for maintaining the schools covered by the scheme, and this includes the duty of defraying all the expenses of maintaining them (except in the case of a voluntary aided school where some of the expenses are, by statute, payable by the governing body). Part of the way in which the Authority maintains schools is through the funding system put in place under sections 45 to 53 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Patterns of offending by young people in Reading are similar to the national picture. The numbers of young offenders overall are falling slowly. A number of youths will receive Out of Court Disposals and most of those sentenced at court are given community based restorative Referral or Youth Rehabilitation Orders.  Those most likely to become young offenders are children and young people who are already vulnerable and marginalised.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Nationally, the number of young people in the Youth Justice System (YJS) continued on a downward trend in 2015-16. The number of young people entering the system for the first time, and the total number receiving disposals and custodial sentences both fell slightly.</p>\n<p>The overall number of young people in the YJS continued to reduce in the year ending March 2015. Reductions have been seen in the number entering the system for the first time (First Time Entrants, FTEs), as well as reductions in those receiving disposals, including those receiving custodial sentences.</p>\n<p>Compared to the year ending March 2010, there are now 67% fewer young people who were FTEs, 65% fewer young people who received a youth caution or court disposal2 and 57% fewer young people (under 18) in custody in the youth secure estate.</p>\n<p>The reoffending rate has increased (by 5.6 percentage points since the year ending March 2008, to 38.0% in the year ending March 2014), but there were significant falls in the number of young people in the cohort, the number of reoffenders and the number of reoffences.</p>\n<p>In 2015-6 there were 194 proven offences committed by young people in Reading; this compares with 217 offences the year before and continues the trend of reducing youth offending. However In 2015-6 there were 69 First time entrants to the Youth Justice System. This is an increase from 53 first time entrants into the Youth Justice System in Reading in 2014-5, the rate increasing from 411 per 100,000 population, to 550. The trend of an increase in first time entrants is against the regional and national trends.</p>\n<h3>Table 1 &#8211; First time entrants to the Youth Justice System 2010-2014</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6557/1/image/11.png\" alt=\"1 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"1b\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6556/1b/image/1b.png\" alt=\"1b \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>The reoffending rate of the young people that are known to the service has stabilised after an increase in the recent period. The numbers of young people in the cohort are small and trends are susceptible to small changes.</p>\n<p>As nationally, the most frequently proven type of offence in Reading (April 2014- Mar 2015) was violence against the person, which accounted for 24.9% of the offences committed (compared to 23.8% in England and Wales). Higher proportions of offences by young people in Reading were recorded for domestic burglary (10.6%, compared to 2.9%, nationally) and motoring offences (10.6%, compared to 7%, nationally).</p>\n<p>Nationally and regionally just over three quarters of young people who offend are male (78% and 76%) in Reading in 2015-6 there are a greater proportion of male offenders at 84%.</p>\n<p>Reading has a demographically more diverse population than the regional and national proportions. Of note however in Reading are the lower number of young people identifying as Asian who offended in 2015-6, compared with the local 2011 census data (5.6% compared with 14%). However, there are correspondingly a greater proportion of white young people in the 2015-6 offending cohort (75% as opposed to 69%) and also of those identifying as black (9.3% as compared with 7.8% of the local population of youth offending age)</p>\n<p>Again reflecting the national picture, in 2015-6 approximately a third of young offenders are given Pre- court outcomes (34% locally, 33% regionally and 31% nationally). However at court the National and regional figures indicate a greater number of Referral Order disposals (47% and 43% respectively.) Reading has only 26% of disposals sentenced with a Referral Order appropriate for young people who plead guilty and are convicted for the first time of an imprisonable offence and with an emphasis on restorative justice. Reading consequently has a greater proportion of Youth Rehabilitation Orders a community based sentence for more serious offenders, combining a range of requirements that can be applied as appropriate than the regional and National proportion. (37% in Reading as compared with 18% regionally and 20% nationally) 7 offences committed by Young People in Reading (5.5% of offences by young people) resulted in a custodial sentence (either a Detention and Training Order (DTO) or a section 90/91 sentence for very serious offences), compared to 4.1% of offences by young people in England and Wales.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Young people who come into contact with the criminal justice system are likely to be amongst the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society, and face greater marginalisation as a result of their offending (British Medical Association, 2014). In 2011 the <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/careasteppingstonetocustody.pdf\">Prison Reform Trust</a> highlighted the high prevalence of looked after children and care leavers in prisons (Blades et al, 2011).</p>\n<p>In 2016, 4.2% of children in Reading aged 10 or older who had been looked after for 12 months or more were convicted or subjected to a Police Reprimand or Final Warning during the year, compared to 5.2% nationally (Department for Education, 2015).</p>\n<p>It is widely accepted that around 60% of young people in the justice system have speech, language and communication needs (Royal College of Speech and Language Therapy). Research clearly shows that SLCN are strongly over-represented within the justice system.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Patterns of offending by young people in Reading are similar to the national picture. The numbers of young offenders are falling slowly and most are sentenced to community based restorative Referral or Youth Rehabilitation Orders.  As elsewhere, around a quarter of offences were violence against the person, suggesting pervasiveness of violence amongst marginalised young people. There appear to be higher levels of domestic burglary and motoring offences by young people in Reading than elsewhere, although it is difficult to know if this difference is statistically significant, and, if it is, whether it reflects true differences in the amount of crime committed by young people, or reflects the rate of crimes detected or differences in the offenders that are successfully charged and convicted. Those most likely to become young offenders are children and young people who are already vulnerable and marginalised. Whilst the offending cohort in Reading is relatively small and demographic differences may vary more significantly over time, the more recent data from Reading suggests that targeted work with young men may be increasingly needed and that certain demographic groups in terms of those identifying as white or as black are more proportionately represented in offending statistics than other demographic groups.</p>\n<h2>National and Local Strategy</h2>\n<p>Local Youth Offending Services (YOS) are multi-agency teams coordinated by Local Authorities that were set up under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to prevent offending or re-offending by children and young people. They look into the background of a young person and try to help them stay away from crime. Usually, the police are the first people to contact the youth offending team but family members and friends can also contact them if they&#8217;re worried about a young person&#8217;s behaviour. The Partnership is overseen by a Youth Justice Management Board including statutory partners, Local Authority, Police, Probation and Health, with representation from the Courts.  The YOS&#8217;s multi agency approach to meeting the needs of young people ensures that it plays a significant role in meeting the safeguarding requirements of these young people.</p>\n<p>The YOS are more actively working to identify and work with those more at risk of reoffending to prevent an escalation of this behaviour and improve their life chances. The YOS are working to assist young people who are not in Education training or Employment to secure and maintain appropriate opportunities in this area. The YOS are committed to identifying and addressing concerns of Child Sexual Exploitation and are screening all open cases. The YOS are aware of the speech and language and communication needs of young people and are screening active cases in this area and looking to develop resources that will address the identified issues. There is strong evidence that there are links between the experience of children and young people and the potential for them to go on and exhibit abusive behaviour on their own relationships. The YOS will continue to develop programmes and approaches for these young people in 2016/7.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>British Medical Association (2014). <em>Young Lives Behind Bars: the health and human rights of children and young people detained in the criminal justice system</em>.

The purpose of the ward profiles is to identify areas for further investigation and to provoke discussion with commissioners and elected members. This user guide is intended to support users in the interpretation of the JSNA Ward profiles. These profiles will be continually developed and we welcome any feedback, comments, and suggestions from users.</p>\n<h3>A note on small area data</h3>\n<p>We need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from data which has come from a small sample. This is because the data is more easily affected by chance variation which is not due to any measurable cause. We strongly recommend reading the further information on interpreting data taken from small samples provided in appendix 1 of this document.</p>\n<p>On occasions particular data may not be available for a Ward. This will be indicated by a missing bar on a chart or will be indicated in the text. This is due to the data containing numbers of less than five. To comply with data protection, these numbers cannot be included due to the risk of identifying individuals who may not wish to be identified.</p>\n<h3>General tips for using the profiles</h3>\n<p>The profiles display a range of indicators which should be considered as a whole picture of the Ward rather than focusing on individual indicators in isolation.</p>\n<p>Information about the age structure and deprivation of the Ward is provided at the beginning of the profiles and this context is essential for interpreting the rest of the profiles, in particular when comparing the Ward to other areas.</p>\n<p>The profiles should be used as a guide to provoke further discussion and investigation. The data cannot be used in isolation and should be supplemented with further data to delve deeper into any issues of interest.</p>\n<p>Any discussion about the information contained within should consider the caveats around the indicators and data included.</p>\n<h2>Step by step guide through the profiles</h2>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This provides a text summary of the information contained within the rest of the profiles. This is accompanied by a &#8216;spine chart&#8217; of key indicators.</p>\n<p>Spine charts are a really useful way of summarising a number of data on one page. They should be used as a quick reference to guide the user to areas particularly worthy of further investigation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4901/image1/image/image1.gif\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<h3>Demographics</h3>\n<p>The demographic data in the profiles provides the contextual information about the Ward. It tells us something of the basic characteristics of the people living in the Ward and should be considered when looking at the rest of the profiles.</p>\n<p>Population data is shown as 2013 mid year population estimates. The remaining demographic data is taken from the Census 2011.</p>\n<p>The population pyramid shows how the age/gender structure of the Ward population compares, on average, to the rest of the local authority. The hollow bars represent the local authority and the filled bars represent the Ward. Females are shown to the left of centre and males to the right. Where there are overlaps, we can identify the differences in population structure.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4902/image2/image/image2.gif\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<h3>Deprivation</h3>\n<p>The index of multiple deprivation (including access to services) is a measure of relative deprivation which ranks each area in the country on a number of measures of deprivation including but not limited to income deprivation. The Ward profiles show where each Ward ranks within the local authority.</p>\n<p>Child poverty figures show the percentage of 0 to 19 year olds living in households in receipt of Child Tax Credits where income is below 60% of median income or in households in receipt of Income Support/Job Seekers Allowance.</p>\n<p>Please see &#8216;education&#8217; for details around the free school meals data.</p>\n<p>The deprivation data in the profiles should be used alongside the demographic data as context when looking at the rest of the profiles.</p>\n<h3>Economy and enterprise</h3>\n<p>Benefit data is presented from 2013. It is important to note that the numbers of benefit claimants may be alter based on the month of the data. All further data included in the economy and enterprise section is sourced from the Census 2011.</p>\n<h3>Education</h3>\n<p>Education data was requested at Ward level from each local authority. Where the authority was able to provide this data then this appears in the profiles. This data will only show children who are resident within the Authority AND are educated in State Maintained schools located within the Authority.</p>\n<h3>Health</h3>\n<p>The health data in the profiles is shown over two pages.</p>\n<p>The first page shows health outcome data such as hospital admissions and deaths. Due to the large differences in these outcomes based on age and gender, these factors have been taken into account using a process call &#8216;indirect standardisation&#8217;. This takes data for a particular indicator (for example, deaths) from a reference population (England) split by age and gender. These figures are then applied to the population of the Ward in order to calculate what we would expect the death rates to be in the Ward. We can then compare the actual Ward value against the expected Ward value.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4903/image3/image/image3.gif\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>The second page looks at lifestyle data (obesity, binge drinking, and healthy eating). There were three stages to calculating Ward level data. These are summarised below;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original source is the individual level Health Survey for England data</li>\n<li>The results of the survey have then been calculated to MSOA level by the Association of Public Health Observatories (now under public health England). They modelled the Health Survey data to the local population using a number of variables such as age, ethnicity, gender, deprivation etc.</li>\n<li>These MSOA level estimates were then calculated to ward level for the Public Health England Local Health tool. They used weighted-populations to disaggregate from MSOA to ward level</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Housing</h3>\n<p>All housing data was sourced from the Census 2011.</p>\n<h3>Community safety</h3>\n<p>All data was sourced from Thames Valley Police and is shown as a rate per 1,000 all age population.</p>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>The urban/rural classification of an area is provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>\n<p>There are six urban/rural classifications; defined as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Major Urban: districts with either 100,000 people or 50 per cent of their population in urban areas with a population of more than 750,000</li>\n<li>Large Urban: districts with either 50,000 people or 50 per cent of their population in one of 17 urban areas with a population between 250,000 and 750,000</li>\n<li>Other Urban: districts with fewer than 37,000 people or less than 26 per cent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns</li>\n<li>Significant Rural: districts with more than 37,000 people or more than 26 per cent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns</li>\n<li>Rural-50: districts with at least 50 per cent but less than 80 per cent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns</li>\n<li>Rural-80: districts with at least 80 per cent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Land use statistics are provided from the General Land Use Database in square metres.</p>\n<p>Domestic energy consumption is sourced from Office for National Statistics Neighbourhood Profiles and is shown in total megawatt hours over three years.</p>\n<h3>FAQ&#8217;s</h3>\n<h3>The data is old, when will it be updated?</h3>\n<p>The data were the most recently available when the profiles were created. The data will be updated on an annual basis. It is unlikely that the majority of the data will change significantly year on year without intervention. You can ask yourself if anything has happened that would cause change in the data since the year of the data in the profiles. If so, it may be worth investigating further.</p>\n<h3>Why is there no data for my Ward?</h3>\n<p>Data will not have been included if numbers are less than five in order to protect individuals from being identified.</p>\n<h3>Why is my Ward better/worse than average?</h3>\n<p>As referred to throughout the user guide, we must be cautious when labelling an area &#8216;worse&#8217; or &#8216;better&#8217; when not using controls to eliminate chance variation in the data. The contextual data should be considered when thinking about why an area&#8217;s value may be higher or lower than the average.</p>\n<h3>What do we need to change?</h3>\n<p>The data in the profiles will not directly answer this question. The profiles are intended to give an overall picture of the Ward and to indicate what areas may need further investigation. A much deeper level of analysis and discussion would be needed to answer what needs to change. The profiles can be used to provoke this discussion.</p>\n<h2>Appendix 1: Small area data</h2>\n<p>We need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from data which has come from a small sample. This is because the data is less reliable in that it is more easily affected by chance variation which is not due to any measurable cause.</p>\n<p>We can measure this chance variation using confidence intervals which are calculated using the size of the sample and a chosen level of confidence (usually 95%). This is illustrated in the table and chart below (data is fictional).</p>\n<p>Although the percentage achieving 5 GCSEs for all areas is the same (50%) the confidence intervals show us that we can be more confident in the figures for Berkshire and for the local authority than we can be for the Ward level figure. For Berkshire we can be 95% confident that, allowing for chance variation, between 49% and 51% of children achieve 5 GCSEs. Within a Berkshire Electoral Ward, this range increases and we can be 95% confident that, allowing for chance variation, between 37% and 63% of children achieve 5 GCSEs.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Example data 1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Area</th>\n<th>Percentage achieving 5 GCSE</th>\n<th>Lower confidence interval</th>\n<th>Upper confidence interval</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Berkshire</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n<td>49%</td>\n<td>51%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Berkshire Local Authority</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n<td>48%</td>\n<td>52%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Berkshire Electoral Ward</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n<td>63%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>This becomes important when comparing two areas or two time periods as illustrated below. At first glance we would say that performance in the Ward (30%) is worse than the Berkshire average (50%). However, the range in which we can be confident the Ward value falls when allowing for chance variation is between 22% and 55%. The upper range is actually higher than the Berkshire average. Therefore, we would have to interpret this as the percentage of children in the Ward achieving 5 GCSEs being no different to the Berkshire average.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Example data 2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Area</th>\n<th>Percentage achieving 5 GCSE</th>\n<th>Lower confidence interval</th>\n<th>Upper confidence interval</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Berkshire</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n<td>49%</td>\n<td>51%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Berkshire Local Authority</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n<td>42%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Berkshire Electoral Ward</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n<td>55%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n",

The Armed Forces provide professional welfare support to augment those provided by local authorities.</p>\n<p>Councils also consider the social care needs of anyone over 18, including includes Veterans, Reservists and adult members of Armed Forces families.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The Ministry of Defence release quarterly statistics on the National and International locations of all UK Regular Forces Personnel and MOD civilian personnel. The most recent release relates to figures as at 1st July 2015. The number or personnel located in the UK and overseas has decreased since the same time point in 2014. The largest concentration of personnel are in the South of England. With the South East having the largest concentration of UK Regular Forces: the region has seen an increase of 180 personnel since 1st July 2014. The Ministry of Defence release annual statistics on the location of Armed Forces Pension and Compensation Recipients. The most recent release relates to data as at 31st March 2015 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/location-of-uk-regular-service-and-civilian-personnel-quarterly-statistics-2015\">(MDa, 2015).</a></p>\n<p>The UKs ex-service population is elderly and declining in size. Nearly half of the ex-service community are over the age of 75. Large numbers in this age group are experiencing problems with mobility and self-care  <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/location-of-uk-regular-service-and-civilian-personnel-quarterly-statistics-2015\">(MDa, 2015).</a></p>\n<p>It is difficult to determine the exact number of people who do retire back to each locality. There is no agreed single process that tracks all service leavers.</p>\n<p>GP Practices can identify the Armed Forces community through the use of Read codes. These are a standard system used in General Practice to support detailed encoding of patient phenomena, including occupation, social circumstances, ethnicity and religion, clinical signs and a variety of administrative items The use of this Primary Care data is currently limited by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Awareness or willingness of the Armed Forces community to identify themselves as such when first registering with a GP; and</li>\n<li>Awareness of the existence of relevant Read codes by GPs and other primary care staff</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Services Careers Transition Partnership do track a percentage of their service leavers for up to 2 years, while the Service Personnel Veterans Agency track those veterans who have approached them.</p>\n<p>Currently Services Resettlement Officers should identify vulnerable service leavers and track their progress. Additional sources for tracking service leavers include Office for National Statistics and census data for ex-service personnel.</p>\n<p>There are no regular forces stationed in Reading. However, Brock Barracks is the headquarters for the Territorial Army unit 7th Battalion the Rifles and for the Berkshire Army Cadet Force. It is also home to the Air Training Corps and Sea Cadet Corps.</p>\n<h2>Facts Figures and Trends</h2>\n<p>Numbers of armed forces personnel living in an area were recorded as part of the 2011 Census. This showed the proportion of personnel who were living in a communal establishment or who were living at home. The majority of armed forces personnel in Reading are living in a household, although this is based on very small numbers.</p>\n<p>Table 1: Armed forces personnel located in Reading, 2011.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4899/image1/image/image1_1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs121ew\"><em>Source: 2011 Census, QS121EW: All usual residents employed in the Armed Forces</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Pension and compensation scheme data can be used as a proxy for the number of veterans in an area (however, not all veterans are in receipt of pension or compensation payments). There are 395 veterans in receipt of a pension/compensation living in Reading.</p>\n<p>Table 2: Residents in receipt of a war pension or compensation, 2014.<span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4900/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Ministry of Defence, Location of Armed Forces Pension and Compensation Recipients <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/location-of-armed-forces-pension-and-compensation-recipients\">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/location-of-armed-forces-pension-and-compensation-recipients</a></p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>The National Armed Forces Covenant sets out the relationship between the nation, the government and the Armed Forces. The Covenant&#8217;s two principles are that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Armed Forces community should not face disadvantage compared to other citizens in the provision of services in the area where they live; and</li>\n<li>special consideration is appropriate in some cases, especially for those who have given the most, such as the injured and the bereaved <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armed-forces-covenant-2015-to-2020\">(MDb, 2015).</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All NHS organisations are covered by the National Armed Forces Covenant.</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council and its partners have signed a <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Reading-Armed-Forces-Community-Covenant.pdf\">Reading Armed Forces Community Covenant</a>. This is a voluntary statement of mutual support between a civilian community and its local Armed Forces community. It is intended to complement the Armed Forces Covenant, which outlines the moral obligation between the Nation, the Government and the Armed Forces, at the local level.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this Community Covenant is to encourage support for the Armed Forces community working and residing in Reading and to recognise and remember the sacrifices made by members of this Armed Forces community, particularly those who have given the most. This includes in-Service and ex-Service personnel, their families and widow(er)s in Reading.</p>\n<p>For Reading Borough Council and partner organisations, the Community Covenant presents an opportunity to bring their knowledge, experience and expertise to bear on the provision of help and advice to members of the Armed Forces community. For the Armed Forces community, the Community Covenant encourages the integration of Service life into civilian life and encourages members of the Armed Forces community to help their local community.</p>\n<p>The development of an Armed Forces Community Covenant for Reading contributes in particular to the Council&#8217;s strategic aim to &#8216;promote equality, social inclusion and a safe and healthy environment for all&#8217; by working to ensure that both serving and ex-Armed Forces personnel can access appropriate support and are able to integrate well into the community.</p>\n<p>This work also relates particularly well to the <a href=\"http://2020.reading-council.org.uk/\">Sustainable Community Strategy&#8217;s</a> &#8216;people&#8217; theme where &#8216;we look after each other&#8217; and the &#8216;prosperity&#8217; theme by aiming to ensure that veterans and reservists are not excluded from the economy. Reading&#8217;s Community Covenant was launched on 7th July 2012 at the Afghanistan Homecoming Parade at Brock Barracks. As stated above Reading does not have a large military &#8216;footprint&#8217;, with no regular forces stationed in the town. However, Brock Barracks is the headquarters for the Territorial Army unit 7th Battalion the Rifles, and Reading is home to a large ex-Gurkha community. Reading&#8217;s Community Covenant therefore focuses on Veterans and Reservists and aims to be proportionate in its scope to the size of the Armed Forces community in Reading.</p>\n<p>Following discussions with 7th Battalion, The Rifles and key partners, an action plan is now in place. Some of the key actions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raise awareness of and signpost to Veteran&#8217;s Mental Health Service for the South Central region</li>\n<li>Work with local businesses to encourage employment of service leavers and reservists; for example, working with Tesco Distribution Centre, who are keen to employ ex-forces personnel</li>\n<li>Promotion of defence discount service/ card amongst town centre businesses</li>\n<li>Establish and implement domestic violence protocol between Service and Civil Police, agencies and charities</li>\n<li>Plan and conduct appropriate event(s) in support of the centenary anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War</li>\n<li>Development of a leaflet on accessing health services to be translated into Nepalese</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new Covenant Fund has recently been set up, with £10 million available every year. This year the priorities for the fund are: community integration projects, the coordination and delivery of support to the armed forces community and projects which address issues facing veterans in the criminal justice system. Under the previous Community Covenant Grant Fund, Reading submitted two successful bids; to run a series of &#8216;health weeks&#8217; for veterans (particularly focusing on ex-Gurkhas and their families) and to support Reading Museum&#8217;s exhibition &#8216;Reading at War&#8217; to commemorate the anniversary of World War One in 2014.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Research shows that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nine out of ten of the people surveyed thought that it was common for personnel leaving the Forces to have some kind of physical, emotional or mental health problem, as a result of their time in the Forces. However, there is limited evidence to support the assertions that the post-national service veteran population in England fares any worse than a comparable population of non-veterans.</li>\n<li>A small minority of veterans do experience difficulties post Service, these tend to manifest themselves on average 10 years post discharge. The presentation of common mental health problems or encounters with the criminal justice system is at a rate less than that in the general population.</li>\n<li>The longer you serve, the less likely you are to have problems; early Service leavers are more likely to have adverse outcomes (such as suicide and mental health problems) and risk taking behaviours (such as heavy alcohol consumption, suicidal thoughts) than longer serving veterans.</li>\n<li>Adverse outcomes in veterans are more commonly associated with Pre-Service adversity/vulnerabilities rather than a consequence of Service life or combat experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Needs of veterans are similar to any other person or family relocating, with the exception that high levels of housing support need may be expected in a small group with major disabilities. A range of voluntary sector agencies have been brought together locally in Berkshire to support families with basic needs for housing, employment and access to mental health support, as identified in Murrison&#8217;s report on military amputees <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/215338/dh_130827.pdf\">(Murrison, 2011)</a>. When a veteran leaves, a summary health record is returned to their GP with a read code of &#8216;History Relating to Military Service&#8217;. Ensuring this is done will help identify needs in future.</p>\n<p>The majority of armed forces families are relatively young women of child bearing age. Spouses often have to cope with being alone by themselves or with the children for quite long periods due to deployment or training. Many families also live away from family support, which can exacerbate this.</p>\n<p>For some groups of conditions, Reservists report higher rates of mental health issues than Regulars. Compared with Regular Armed Forces Families, there can be even greater isolation for Reservists&#8217; Families.</p>\n<p>The younger population make up 6% of the ex-service community. Veterans aged 16 to 64 in particular are more likely than the general population to report a long term illness. This includes depression, mobility issues and sensory impairment. They are also less likely to be in employment, and more likely to suffer from financial difficulties and have caring responsibilities <a

inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Veterans needs are similar to any other person or family relocating, with the exception that high levels of housing support need may be expected in a small group with major disabilities</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>Many veterans find the way health issues are managed in the transition from military to civilian life unsatisfactory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patients or NHS staff are not always aware of veteran&#8217;s priority of access to treatment (if a condition relates to their military service);</li>\n<li>Problems about the transfer of medical records;</li>\n<li>Difficulties in the continuity of care;</li>\n<li>Medical personnel do not always know or understand the patient&#8217;s military background.</li>\n<li>Access to services is a key issue for Armed Forces Families , including:</li>\n<li>Time accrued on NHS waiting lists it not always honoured when moving to a new area;</li>\n<li>Family members receiving care in one area often find that they don&#8217;t meet the criteria of the new area;</li>\n<li>Spouses who have been waiting for mental health treatment often get the treatment required just before they move and have to start again;</li>\n<li>Some families who are carers for a family member with additional needs/disability find it difficult to access short breaks or support when their spouse is deployed or away training.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Provision of health care being regularly switched between military and NHS services can be a problem for Reservists, particularly with respect to the transfer of medical records and continuity of care.</p>\n<p>Healthwatch Reading highlighted a number of issues experienced by the ex-Gurkha community in accessing

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The ways in which places and transport are planned influence people&#8217;s living, working and travel patterns; their access to job, goods, services and social network; and their propensity to be physically active. A number of factors contribute to the ways in which people travel to, from and around Reading, including whether they feel safe to walk and cycle, how well public transport meets their needs, the availability of parking and the capacity of the road network. A higher proportion of working age people in Reading walk or cycle to work than elsewhere and walking is the dominant method of travel into and out of the town centre. However, as elsewhere, the largest proportion of commuters still travels by car or van. Barriers to active travel, such as busy roads, complex junctions and &#8216;severance&#8217; of pedestrian routes (by rivers or railways, for example) may affect willingness to walk or cycle. Developments to walking and cycling routes and improvements in safety are likely to enable people in Reading to walk and cycle more, thereby increasing the amount of regular physical activity they take and helping to improve their health.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>A number of factors contribute to the ways in which people travel to, from and around Reading, including whether they feel safe to walk and cycle, how well public transport meets their needs, the availability of parking and the capacity of the road network.</p>\n<p>Some of the key characteristics of transport infrastructure, patterns of use and challenges in Reading are as follows (details from Reading&#8217;s Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 (LTP3)):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The M4 motorway is a key route in the Thames Valley and South East and runs east to west just south of the borough, with three junctions offering access to the urban area. The M4 carries large volumes of traffic and can experience severe congestion in peak periods. Within Reading, traffic congestion occurs on a number of radial routes and in Central Reading on the Inner Distribution Road (IDR).</li>\n<li>Reading is one of the UK&#8217;s busiest rail stations and caters for around 14 million passengers every year. Reading is the only railway station where as many people arrive as leave in the peak hours, indicating its importance to both local employers and residents.</li>\n<li>Walking is the dominant method of travel into and out of central Reading, but the number of pedestrian movements is significantly lower outside of the central area. People are deterred from walking by infrastructure obstacles such as major roads, railway lines and rivers.</li>\n<li>Reading Borough Council has a Cycling Strategy, which, in line with national strategy, sets out to increase sustainability in local transport by encouraging people to cycle to work, for leisure and for everyday journeys. The local strategy describes plans to: bridge gaps to infrastructural barriers such as the river and railway; provide greater access to cycle hire and cycle parking facilities; and positively promote the benefits of cycling in a compact urban centre. Despite increases in numbers of cycle journeys, issues such as heavy traffic, complex junctions, route surfaces, lighting and cycle parking continue to deter people from cycling.</li>\n<li>Reading has a comprehensive bus network with extensively upgraded services. Buses are high quality, frequent, and tracked by satellite technology. Nonetheless the network still suffers from some congestion and delays, particularly in peak times. Reading has the highest use of &#8216;PlusBus&#8217; tickets, allowing passengers to interchange directly between train and bus journeys. Major flows from train to bus are to the University of Reading, the three major business parks (Green Park, Thames Valley Park and Reading International Business Park) and to schools within Reading.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Facts, Figures and Trends</h2>\n<p>In 2011, 31% of Reading residents (36,229 people) of working age reported that they usually drove to work in a car, van or motorcycle, compared to 35.4% in England. More people in Reading reported travelling by train or bus, on foot and by bicycle than the England average.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: Method of travelling to work &#8211; Reading residents aged 16-75</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"fig1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6549/fig1/image/fig1.png\" alt=\"fig1 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: 2011 Census: Method of travel to work (2001 specification), local authorities in England and Wales</p>\n<p>In comparison with similar Local Authority areas in the South East, a smaller percentage reported commuting by motorcycle, car or van in Reading than elsewhere (Table 1). Reading was ranked 12th of all Local Authorities in England and Wales of those with the highest proportion who reported that they walked to work.</p>\n<h3>Table 1: Method of travelling to work (Census 2011)</h3>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"JSNA Transport\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\"><strong>Local Authority Area</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"6\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Method of travelling to work (%, 2011 Census)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Driving car or van</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Driving motorcycle</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Train</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Bus</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cycle</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Walking</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading</td>\n<td>30.6</td>\n<td>0.4</td>\n<td>6.4</td>\n<td>7.4</td>\n<td>2.8</td>\n<td>11.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>England</td>\n<td>34.9</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td>3.3</td>\n<td>4.7</td>\n<td>1.9</td>\n<td>6.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slough</td>\n<td>39.0</td>\n<td>0.4</td>\n<td>4.5</td>\n<td>4.9</td>\n<td>1.6</td>\n<td>6.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Southampton</td>\n<td>32.5</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td>1.7</td>\n<td>5.7</td>\n<td>2.9</td>\n<td>9.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Portsmouth</td>\n<td>31.2</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td>2.2</td>\n<td>4.6</td>\n<td>4.6</td>\n<td>10.1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: 2011 Census: Method of travel to work (2001 specification), local authorities in England and Wales</p>\n<h3>2011 Census data also indicated that:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>33,960 workers resident in Reading also worked in the Borough (42% of the resident population and 46% of those working in Reading).</li>\n<li>32,759 workers resident in Reading commuted to another Local Authority area for work (41% of the resident population).</li>\n<li>42,309 workers commuted into Reading from outside the Borough (47% of those working in Reading).</li>\n<li>7,080 workers resident in Reading usually worked at home (9% of the resident population and 8% of those working in Reading).</li>\n<li>6,199 workers had no fixed workplace (8% of the resident population and 7% of those working in Reading).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Neighbourhood Statistics, Commuting Patterns in the United Kingdom, 2011 Census).</p>\n<p>Although Reading has a higher proportion of people walking or cycling to work than elsewhere, the proportion that travels to work by car, van or motorcycle is still by far the largest. 14% of the working age population reported walking or cycling to work (active travel) in 2011.</p>\n<h3>Figure 2: Proportion of working age population in Reading travelling to work by different methods</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"fig2pie\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6543/fig2pie/image/fig2pie.png\" alt=\"fig2pie \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: 2011 Census: Method of travel to work (2001 specification), local authorities in England and Wales</p>\n<p>The safety of cycling and walking, especially on busy roads or complex junctions, affects people&#8217;s decisions about whether to walk or cycle rather than travel in another way. In general, the rate of road accidents in Reading is similar or better than average. The rate of all people reported killed or seriously injured on Reading&#8217;s roads between 2012 and 2014 was 28.3 per 100,000 people, significantly better than the England average of 39.3 and the rate of 41.5 per 100,000 amongst Local Authorities with similar levels of deprivation. While the rate of children killed or seriously injured in road traffic accidents has remained statistically similar to the national average in recent years, the data suggest an improvement from 22.6 per 100,000 in 2011-13 to 10.5 per 100,000 in 2012-14.</p>\n<p>Accidents are most common in areas with high levels of pedestrian activity combined with complex junctions and high vehicle flows and often involve vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Road accident data recorded by Thames Valley Police continues to illustrate that most accidents took place on weekdays in the peak travel times, with most taking place on Oxford Road and the A329 corridor (a busy major route running through East and West Reading and to the South of the town centre including London Road, Cemetery Junction, Christchurch Road, Inner Distribution Road and Oxford Road), specifically Kings Road. See Figures 1, 2 and 3.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: Number of pedestrian and cycle accidents on A-Roads in Reading*</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"fig1accidents\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6544/fig1accidents/image/fig1accidents.png\" alt=\"fig1accidents \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Stats 19 Data<br />\n* Accidents occurred between 1st July 2013 and 30th June 2016</p>\n<h3>Figure 2: Number of pedestrian and cycle accidents on A-Roads in Reading by time of day (24 hour)*</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"fig2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6545/fig2/image/fig2.png\" alt=\"fig2 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: STATS 19 Data<br />\n* Accidents occurred between 1st July 2013 and 30th June 2016</p>\n<h3>Figure 3: Number of pedestrian and cycle casualties in Reading by day of the week*</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"fig3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6546/fig3/image/fig3.png\" alt=\"fig3 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Transport<br />\n* Accidents occurred between 1st July 2013 and 30th June 2016</p>\n<p>High levels of traffic also contribute to high carbon emissions and poor air quality, which have been linked to health problems including cardiovascular diseases and exacerbation of pre-existing respiratory and pulmonary conditions, including asthma. In 2013, PHE estimated that 5.7% of deaths in Reading were attributable to poor air quality, similar to the England average of 5.3% and the average of other Local Authority areas with similar levels of deprivation of 5.5% (IMD 2010) in the same period (see Public Health Outcomes Framework, Indicator 3.01).</p>\n<p>Both air quality and road traffic accidents are recognised as contributing to relative deprivation and are taken into account when measuring deprivation levels through the Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The outdoors living environment sub-domain of the IMD takes into account 1) the concentration of pollutants in the air and 2) road traffic accidents involving injury to pedestrians and cyclists. Abbey, Caversham and Battle wards, central to the Borough and with the most significant traffic flows, score the worst on this domain, while the wards most remote from the centre are least affected (see Figure 4 &#8211; darker blue areas indicate worse scores, lighter blue areas indicate better scores).</p>\n<h3>Figure 4: IMD Outdoor Living Environment Sub-domain Score by Ward (2015)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"fig4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6547/fig4/image/fig4.jpg\" alt=\"fig4 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Outdoors Sub-domain Score (IMD 2015).

However, as elsewhere, the largest proportion of commuters still travels by car or van. Barriers to active travel, such as busy roads, complex junctions and &#8216;severance&#8217; of pedestrian routes (by rivers or railways, for example) may affect willingness to walk or cycle. While levels of road accidents in Reading are better than average, busy areas around the town centre and in busy periods are disproportionately affected, meaning that routes into central Reading may be more daunting and dangerous to vulnerable road users. High traffic flows in central areas, especially the town centre, Cemetery Junction, and Oxford Road, has an impact on air quality in these areas.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Those living in areas in and immediately around the town centre are more likely to be affected by greater risk of road accidents and poor air quality, affecting quality of life, respiratory health and willingness to walk or cycle. In areas more remote from the town centre, infrastructural barriers such as the river and railway, poor lighting, busy roads and lack of cycle lanes and parking may have an impact on the practicalities of walking and cycling.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</h2>\n<p>Developments to walking and cycling routes and improvements in safety are likely to enable people in Reading to walk and cycle more, thereby increasing the amount of regular physical activity they take and helping to improve their health.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/air-quality/\">Air Quality</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/employment/\">Employment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/physical-activity/\">Physical Activity</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Data.gov.uk (2016). <em>Road Safety Data</em> (STATS 19 Data).

    "title": "Teenage pregnancy rates",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Teenage pregnancy is a significant public health issue in England. Teenage parents are prone to poor antenatal health, lower birth weight babies and higher infant mortality rates. Their health, and that of their children, is likely to be worse than average. Teenage mothers are less likely to finish their education, less likely to find a good job, and more likely to end up both as single parents and bringing up their children in poverty. The children themselves run a much greater risk of poor health, and have a much higher chance of becoming teenage mothers themselves.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The UK still has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Western Europe, in England in 2013 over 22,800 women under the age of 18 became pregnant, approximately 5,000 of whom were under the age of 16 (<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/bulletins/conceptionstatistics/2015-02-24\">ONS, 2015</a>). Only about 5% of under 18 conceptions are to girls aged 14 or under and to include younger age groups in the base population would produce misleading results. The 15-17 age groups are effectively treated as the population at risk.</p>\n<p>However, teenage pregnancy rates are at their lowest level for over 20 years. In Reading, effective local delivery of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy has reversed the previous upward trend. The latest available data for 2013 shows the under-18 conception rate in Reading has been reduced to around 23/1000. This is a reduction of around 52% since 2009.</p>\n<p>The under 16 years of age conception rate is low but remains of considerable concern. It is a trend across the country that the proportion of under 16s conceptions resulting in a termination of pregnancy is higher for the under 16s than for the older age group.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>Table 1 shows data on; actual number of conceptions, conception rates per 1,000 females in the age group and percentage of conceptions leading to abortion. They cover England, the South East and Reading authority areas. The data are an aggregation over the rolling 3 year periods and are based on the under 16 year olds (aged 13 to 15) female population. The data are based on the number of actual pregnancies which led to either a maternity or a termination of pregnancy by abortion. This data is over a four year rolling period (2008 to 2010 and 2011 to 2013).</p>\n<p>The conception rate has consistently been higher to females under the age of 16 years living in Reading compared to the averages across the South East Region and England as a whole. The national trend has continued to reduce from 7.2/1000 in 2008/10 to 5.5/1000 in 2011/13. A similar downward trend has been seen across the South East region (5.8/1000 in 2008/10 to 4.5/1000 in 2011/13). Over recent years the trend for Reading has been following an upward direction. A recent drop in rates has been seen in for Reading (6.9/1000 for 2011/13) which is encouraging, however, we cannot say yet that the overall trend is going downwards. Trends will need to be monitored over the next few years to see if downward trend is observed and can be reported. Rates are similar in Reading to the average of Local Authorities with similar levels of deprivation.</p>\n<p>Over the 2008/10 period, the proportion of conceptions to under 16 years olds living in Reading, that resulted in a termination, was slightly lower than what was seen nationally and across the South East Region. Data for Reading from 2009/11 to 2011/13 is not shown due to the small numbers in the data and has been withheld due to patient confidentiality issues.</p>\n<p>Table 1: Under 16 conceptions/outcomes</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Table 1: Under 16 conceptions/outcomes\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>England data</th>\n<th>2008/10</th>\n<th>2009/11</th>\n<th>2010/12</th>\n<th>2011/13</th>\n<th>2012/14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of conceptions</td>\n<td>20,153</td>\n<td>18,683</td>\n<td>17,048</td>\n<td>15,155</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conception rate per 1,000 women in age group</td>\n<td>7.2</td>\n<td>6.7</td>\n<td>6.1</td>\n<td>5.5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of conceptions leading to abortion</td>\n<td>61.6</td>\n<td>61.1</td>\n<td>61.2</td>\n<td>60.8</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>South East data</th>\n<th>2008/10</th>\n<th>2009/11</th>\n<th>2010/12</th>\n<th>2011/13</th>\n<th>2012/14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of conceptions</td>\n<td>2,641</td>\n<td>2,456</td>\n<td>2,294</td>\n<td>2,042</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conception rate per 1,000 women in age group</td>\n<td>5.7</td>\n<td>5.3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4.5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of conceptions leading to abortion</td>\n<td>61.4</td>\n<td>61.8</td>\n<td>63.2</td>\n<td>63.3</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading data</th>\n<th>2008/10</th>\n<th>2009/11</th>\n<th>2010/12</th>\n<th>2011/13</th>\n<th>2012/14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of conceptions</td>\n<td>52</td>\n<td>58</td>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conception rate per 1,000 women in age group</td>\n<td>7.6</td>\n<td>8.3</td>\n<td>8.6</td>\n<td>6.9</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of conceptions leading to abortion</td>\n<td>55.8</td>\n<td>c</td>\n<td>c</td>\n<td>c</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>c denotes confidential</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/bulletins/conceptionstatistics/2015-02-24\"><em>ONS (2015)</em></a></p>\n<p>Table 2 shows data on; actual number of conceptions, conception rates per 1,000 females in the age group and percentage of conceptions leading to abortion.

The national trend has continued to reduce from 37.0/1000 in 2008/10 to 27.6/1000 in 2011/13. A similar downward trend has been seen across the South East region (30.3/1000 in 2008/10 to 23.3/1000 in 2011/13). Over recent years the trend for Reading has been following the same pattern but at an increased rate. The local rate has reduced from 43.4/1000 in 2008/10 to 31.0/1000 in 2011/13. The drop in rates is testament to the implementation of the local Teenage Pregnancy Strategy and the hard work of local partners across sectors. However, the data in the table below shows that Reading is still higher than national and regional figures.</p>\n<p>The proportion of conceptions to under 18 years olds nationally, that resulted in a termination, has remained fairly static over recent years at around 49.6%. Across the South East Region there has been a slight upward trend (50.9% in 2008/10 to 52.2% in 2011/13). Reading has witnessed an upward trend also but at a far higher pace.

    "title": "Suicide and self harm",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>While the number of people who lose their lives to suicide in Reading is small, each individual suicide comes at a high cost to society (an estimated £1.67 million, including the direct costs of care, indirect costs relating to loss of productivity and earnings, and the intangible costs associated with pain, grief and suffering) and, on average, ten other people are directly affected by each suicide, often at a significant detriment to their wellbeing (Knapp, McDaid and Parsonage, 2011; Platt, Maclean, McCollam et al, 2006). The risk of death by suicide is not the same for all local people, but is higher in key risk groups (those with mental health problems, those using drugs and alcohol and involved with the criminal justice system, those with a history of trauma and abuse, and those living in deprivation and poorer social conditions), which are likely to include some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of our local community. Local and national policies to target suicide prevention initiatives on reaching these groups and responding effectively to self-harm, both in its own right and as a potential warning sign for suicide, are likely to help reduce the impact of suicide on local people.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Suicide is the act of intentionally ending your life and is most common amongst men and amongst those aged 30-59 (ONS, 2016). In 2015, across all age groups, the rate for men was around three times higher than for women. A death is included in UK suicide statistics where a coroner has recorded that the reason for a death was intentional self-harm or events of undetermined intent (these are customarily assumed to be self- inflicted but where there is insufficient evidence to prove that the deceased deliberately meant to kill themselves) (ONS,2016). A coroner can record a verdict of suicide in anyone aged 10 years or older.</p>\n<p>While the number of people who take their own lives in England has reduced over the last 30 years, rates started to increase from 2008 and, in the most recent three year period, were similar to those seen in 2001-03. Men are at greater risk of suicide than women &#8211; 15.8 per 100,000 men died between 2013 and 2015 compared to 4.5 per 100,000 women &#8211; with the highest rate amongst men aged 35-49 (DH, 2012; ONS, 2017). However, registrations for 2015, the most recent statistics available, showed a small decrease in the number of suicides by men and an increase in the number of suicides by women (ONS, 2017).</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Table 1: Age-standardised suicide rate by year by gender, deaths registered between 1981 and 2015 (England)\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/7018/Table-1-Age-standardised-suicide-rate-by-year-by-gender-deaths-registered-between-1981-and-2015-England/image/Suicide_rate_by_year_and_gender_between_1981_and_2015.JPG\" alt=\"Table 1: Age-standardised suicide rate by year by gender, deaths registered between 1981 and 2015 (England) \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Table 1: Age-standardised suicide rate by year by gender, deaths registered between 1981 and 2015 (England)</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: ONS, 2017 <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2014registrations#main-points\">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2014registrations#main-points</a></p>\n<p>As you would expect, the number of deaths attributed to suicide in Reading is small compared to the number seen nationally. Between 2013 and 2015, 44 deaths in Reading were recorded as suicide or resulting from an injury of undetermined intent. As the numbers are so small, it is much more difficult to identify trends from local data in isolation. The number of suicides by women in Reading is too low for the rate per 100,000 people in the population to be published for comparison by Public Health England (PHE) as the results are likely to be too unstable and fluctuate too widely to be meaningfully compared to rates in other populations, especially when adjusted for different population&#8217;s age profiles. In the latest (2013-15) period, the suicide rates for men and for all persons, while statistically similar to the rates for England, are both higher than the England rates (11 per 100,000 in Reading compared to 10 per 100,000 for all persons in England and 19 per 100,000 for men compared to 15.8 per 100,000 for men in England), but both were lower than the England rate in preceding periods. While this may represent real changes in the local area, the low number of cases and the possibility that the differences may be the result of chance makes these figures difficult to interpret (Table 2).</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Table 2: Suicide rate per 100,00 people (2001-03 to 2013-15) Reading and England\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/7019/Table-2-Suicide-rate-per-10000-people-2001-03-to-2013-15-Reading-and-England/image/Table_2_Suicide_rate_per_100_00_people_Reading_and_England.JPG\" alt=\"Table 2: Suicide rate per 100,00 people (2001-03 to 2013-15) Reading and England \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Table 2: Suicide rate per 100,00 people (2001-03 to 2013-15) Reading and England</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England (Based on ONS Source), Public Health Outcomes Framework indicator 4.10</p>\n<p>Risk factors for suicide include drug and alcohol use, a history of trauma or abuse, being unemployed or having poor job security, social isolation and family breakdown, living in deprivation or poor social conditions, imprisonment and involvement with the criminal justice system, and living with a mental health condition (<a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/s/suicide\">Mental Health Foundation</a>; <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Suicide/Pages/Causes.aspx\">NHS Choices</a>)</p>\n<p>Another key risk factor for suicide is a history of self-harm, and indeed this is the single factor which most reliably indicates increased suicide risk. More than half of all people who die by suicide have a history of self-harm (NHS Choices). Self-harm is more prevalent amongst younger people (NICE, 2011) and can take the form of self-poisoning with medication, giving an injury (such as by burning or cutting skin or pulling hair, or hitting or punching) or can include harmful drug or alcohol use, some kinds of eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa, and excessive exercise (<a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/self-harm/#.WL1ow_P5fcs\">Mind</a>, NHS Choices, NICE, 2011). Self-harm has been linked to social problems and experiences of trauma (for example, being bullied, problematic relationships with friends and family, abuse, coping with the death of a loved one) and in some cases with psychological causes such as intrusive, uncontrollable thoughts or feelings of disassociation from self and surroundings.</p>\n<h2>National and local strategies</h2>\n<p>A cross-Government National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England was published in 2012. This included commitments to tackling suicide in six key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the risk of suicide in high risk groups;</li>\n<li>Tailoring approaches to improve mental health in specific groups;</li>\n<li>Reducing access to means of suicide;</li>\n<li>Providing better information and support to those bereaved or affected by suicide;</li>\n<li>Supporting the media in delivering sensitive approaches to suicide and suicidal behaviour; and</li>\n<li>Supporting research, data collection and monitoring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2016, an independent Mental Health Taskforce presented a report &#8211; The Five Year Forward View for Mental Health &#8211; to the NHS in England. The Taskforce recommended setting a national ambition to reduce the suicide rate in England by 10 per cent by 2020-21, and that every local area should have in place a multi-agency suicide prevention plan. These local plans are expected to align with local Crisis Care Concordat action plans, and to reflect local ambitions for prevention planning.</p>\n<p>The 3rd Progress Report on Preventing Suicide in England (published in January 2017) contains further guidance on local suicide prevention plans. Local plans should be in place by 2017, set out targeted actions in line with the national Suicide Prevention Strategy and new evidence around suicide, and include a strong focus on primary care, alcohol and drug misuse. Each plan should demonstrate how areas will implement evidence-based preventative interventions that target high-risk locations and support high-risk groups within their population.</p>\n<p>Suicide prevention work is part of promoting good mental health more broadly, and there is an increasing focus on mental health as a vital part of overall wellbeing. In January 2017 the Brighter Berkshire (Year of Mental Health) campaign was launched. This is aimed at reducing stigma and improving access to support networks.</p>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2017-20 includes &#8216;reducing deaths by suicide&#8217; as one of its eight priorities, with a further two priorities complementing this very closely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoting positive mental health and wellbeing in children and young people</li>\n<li>Reducing loneliness and social isolation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Suicide Prevention Plan support both the local Health and Wellbeing Strategy and the Berkshire-wide Suicide Prevention Strategy (based on the national strategy) endorsed by Reading&#8217;s Health and Wellbeing Board in March 2017.</p>\n<h3>What is this telling us?</h3>\n<p>While it is difficult to determine the relative risk of suicide to people in Reading compared to people living elsewhere in the UK, it is possible to identify key risk groups within our population (those with mental health problems, those using drugs and alcohol and involved with the criminal justice system, those with a history of trauma and abuse, and those living in deprivation and poorer social conditions). Local and national policies to target suicide prevention initiatives on these groups and to respond effectively to self-harm, both in its own right and as a potential warning sign for suicide, are likely to help reduce the rate of suicide locally.</p>\n<h3>What are the key inequalities?</h3>\n<p>It is well acknowledged that there are key groups that are at greater risk of suicide than others and both local and national policies have acknowledged the need to ensure that interventions are targeted effectively. Each of these groups is likely to include some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of our local community.</p>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Suicide Prevention Action Plan includes a series of plans to ensure actions are aimed at reducing the health inequalities in this area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A review of services commissioned to reach younger men</li>\n<li>Raising awareness of support for those bereaved by suicide</li>\n<li>Raising awareness of local support for survivors of sexual abuse</li>\n<li>Addressing suicide risk through the implementation of the Domestic Abuse Strategy</li>\n<li>Supporting delivery of the Future in Mind programme to improve mental health in children and young people</li>\n<li>Ensuring drug and alcohol support services include suicide prevention objectives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/offenders/\">Offenders</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/drugs-and-alcohol/\">Drugs &amp; Alcohol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/deprivation-by-ward-and-lower-super-output-area/\">Deprivation by Ward and Lower Super Output Area</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Department of Health (DH) (2012). <em>Suicide prevention strategy for England</em>.

    "title": "Smoking in young people",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Trying smoking as a teenager is a significant risk factor for becoming a regular, long-term smoker and for developing one or more health problems associated with smoking. Those most at risk of smoking at a young age are girls (although girls tend to try their first cigarette at an older age than boys), , those with a White British or Mixed ethnic background, those whose friends also smoke and those who also engage in drinking alcohol, using drugs, and truanting. Smoking in all ages disproportionately affects those affected by deprivation and is the main factor accounting for gap in healthy life expectancy between the wealthy and the most deprived.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Smoking is the main cause of preventable ill health and premature death in adults in England and is the main factor accounting for the gap in healthy life expectancy between people who live in the wealthiest parts of our community and the most deprived (NICE, 2015).</p>\n<p>Most smokers start smoking in their teens and continue to smoke long into adulthood. Starting smoking earlier in life usually means smoking for longer and this increases the risk of the health problems associated with smoking (NHS, 2016, WHO, 2016). There is evidence to suggest that young people become addicted to nicotine very quickly and that those who try a cigarette at a young age were more likely to become regular smokers (ASH, 2015, NICE, 2015).</p>\n<p>Data collected through the &#8216;What about YOUth?&#8217; (WAY) survey was used to measure smoking prevalence among 15 year olds in England for the first time in 2014. The survey collected local questionnaire data from 15 year olds who were randomly selected from the National Pupil Database (NPD). The questionnaire covered a range of topics related to the welfare and wellbeing of young people including smoking, emotional wellbeing, diet, physical activity, drugs, alcohol and bullying. Smoking prevalence data are reported through the Public Health Outcomes Framework and can be benchmarked against other Local Authority areas.</p>\n<p>In 2014 the survey found that 24% of 15 year olds in England had ever smoked and 8% were current smokers. Girls were more likely to smoke than boys, but tended to try a cigarette for the first time at an older age. The average age of first trying a cigarette was 13-14 years. Those from deprived areas were more likely to smoke than those from privileged areas. When analysed by ethnicity, those who described their ethnicity as White or Mixed were most likely to have smoked, and those from Asian ethnicity groups were least likely to have smoked. The survey also found regional differences in smoking patterns: those living in London were the least likely to smoke and those in the North East were most likely to smoke (Ipsos MORI, 2015).</p>\n<p>In each category (current, regular and occasional smokers) prevalence in Reading was not significantly different to the England averages or the South East averages. Prevalence of current smoking and regular smoking were not significantly different from the averages for Local Authority areas with similar levels of deprivation, but prevalence of occasional smoking was significantly lower than in these areas (see Table 1 below).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Estimated prevalence of current, regular and occasional smoking amongst 15 year olds (with confidence intervals)</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Table 1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<th>England</th>\n<th>South East</th>\n<th>Reading&#8217;s 2010 Deprivation Decile (fifth less deprived)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Current Smokers</td>\n<td>8.2% (6.5%-9.9%)</td>\n<td>8.2% (8.1%-8.3%</td>\n<td>9% (8.6%-9.4%)</td>\n<td>9% (8.5%-9.5%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regular Smokers</td>\n<td>6.1% (4.6%-7.6%)</td>\n<td>5.5% (5.4%-5.6%)</td>\n<td>5.8% (5.5%-6.1%)</td>\n<td>5.6% (5.2%-6.0%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Occasional Smokers</td>\n<td>2.1 % (1.2%-3%)</td>\n<td>2.7% (2.6%-2.8%)</td>\n<td>2.7% (2.6%-2.8%</td>\n<td>3.4% (3.1%-3.7%)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework (indicators 2.09-2.09ii)</p>\n<p>In comparison with Local Authority areas with similar levels of deprivation, prevalence in Reading did not appear significantly different to the average (see Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators 2.09-2.09ii), but there was a mixed picture across areas in the decile.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Percentage of Current Smokers (15 year olds) 2014 &#8211; Local Authority Areas in 2010 IMD Deprivation Decile &#8211; Fourth less deprived <span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6158/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcome Framework (Indicators 2.09-209ii)</p>\n<p>The Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use (SDD) surveys monitor smoking, drinking and drug use amongst secondary age pupils in England. 2014 survey results showed that 18% of those surveyed reported ever trying a cigarette (&#8220;even just one puff&#8221;), this is the lowest prevalence of smoking amongst young people since the survey began in 1982. The SDD survey also found that girls were more likely to smoke than boys and also indicated that rising age was associated with being a regular smoker and with trying smoking (figure 2).</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Smoking behaviour by age (England) <span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6159/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use Among Young People in England &#8211; 2014, HSCIC</p>\n<p>Smoking in young people was also associated with drinking alcohol, taking drugs, truanting from school and having friends who smoked (NatCen, 2015).</p>\n<p>The Local Tobacco Control Alliance have also regularly conducted an annual Smoking &amp; Drinking Amongst Young People in West Berkshire, Reading &amp; Wokingham survey. In 2015/16, two Reading schools participated in this, with a total of 1693 completed questionnaires being received from pupils aged 11-17 years. The results from this survey mirror much of the patterns that are being reported nationally and, it provides an important source of local intelligence, particularly around the supply of cigarettes and alcohol to young people.</p>\n<p>In addition to smoking by young people, second-hand smoke is particularly dangerous for children and young people. In 2010 the Royal College of Physicians (RCoP) described second-hand smoke as a major hazard to the health of children who live with smokers with most harm occurring in the home. There is evidence that there are associations between second-hand smoke and increase risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, asthma and wheezing, middle ear infection and bacterial meningitis.</p>\n<h2>National and Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A Tobacco Control Plan for England was published by the Department of Health in 2011 and sets out the government&#8217;s strategy to reduce smoking prevalence in adults to 18.5% or less, smoking amongst 15 year olds to 12% or less and smoking during pregnancy to 11% or less by the end of 2015 by: stopping the production of tobacco; making tobacco less affordable; effectively regulating the sale of tobacco products; helping tobacco users to quit; reducing exposure to secondhand smoke; and communicating effectively for tobacco control.</p>\n<p>Quality Standards developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) are designed to draw together existing guidance on high priority issues, providing comprehensive recommendations that are not restricted to healthcare settings but can be applied across sectors. NICE Quality Standard QS82 addresses reducing and preventing tobacco use and makes the following recommendations particularly related to smoking amongst young people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schools and colleges deliver combined interventions to stop children and young people taking up smoking by improving their social competence and awareness of social influences.</li>\n<li>Schools and colleges do not allow smoking anywhere in their grounds and remove any areas previously designated for smoking.</li>\n<li>Trading standards identify and take action against retailers that sell tobacco products to people under 18.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Most smokers take up smoking in their teens and those who try a cigarette as teenagers are more likely to become regular smokers. The earlier a person starts smoking, the longer they are likely to be a smoker and the greater the risks to their health.</p>\n<p>Rates of smoking amongst 15 year olds in Reading are similar to national, regional and the 2010 deprivation decile averages, with 8.2% describing themselves as current smokers and 6.1% describing themselves as regular smokers. National prevalence data from the SDD suggests average prevalence of regular smoking of 4% in 14 year olds and 2% in 13 year olds and 0% in 11 and 12 year olds. Applying these to the ONS mid-year population estimates to 2014 suggests almost 200 young people aged 11-15 years old in Reading were regular smokers in 2014.</p>\n<p>Those most at risk of smoking at a young age are girls (although girls tend to try their first cigarette at an older age than boys), those who are economically deprived, those with a White British or Mixed ethnic background, those whose friends also smoke and those who also engage in drinking alcohol, using drugs, and truanting.</p>\n<h2>What are the key health inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Smoking in all ages disproportionately affects those affected by deprivation and is the main factor accounting for gap in healthy life expectancy between those living in the wealthiest areas of our community and the most deprived (NICE, 2015).</p>\n<h2>Links to other sections in the JSNA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cancer/\">Cancer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cardiovascular-disease/\">Cardiovascular Disease</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/children-and-young-people/\">Children &amp; Young People</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/common-causes-of-death-and-disability/\">Common causes of death &amp; disability</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/deprivation-by-ward-and-lower-super-output-area/\">Deprivation by Ward and Lower Super Output Area</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/drugs-and-alcohol/\">Drugs &amp; Alcohol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/smoking/\">Smoking</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/smoking-in-pregnancy/\">Smoking in Pregnancy</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), 2015.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Smoking is the single biggest cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in England and the most significant thing that a smoker can do to improve their health is to quit smoking. In the case of smoking in pregnancy, it is also one of the best things as smoker can do for the health of their unborn child. Smoking and being exposed to second-hand smoke, poses a significant risk to both mother and unborn child, including increasing their risks of developing smoking-related illness.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Smoking rates in adult men and women have more than halved in the last 30 years. Despite this, it is estimated that there are still 10 million adults who smoke in Great Britain today, and about half of the regular smokers will die prematurely as a result of their smoking (ASH, 2015).</p>\n<p>Smoking kills almost 80,000 people in England each year and is the number one cause of preventable death in the country. Smoking continues to be one of the biggest health challenges and continues to contribute significantly to health inequalities in our communities (PHE, 2015).</p>\n<p>There are more than 4,000 compounds found in tobacco smoke and whilst many have a <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBXS.pdf\">toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic effect</a>,, nicotine is one of the most important chemical compounds that make tobacco products addictive. Whilst addiction is a complex combination of pharmacology, learned behaviour, genetics, and social and environmental factors, cigarettes are a highly efficient system by which nicotine is delivered to the body (RCP, 2000; SG, 2010). When smoke is drawn in, the large surface area of the lungs helps the nicotine rapidly cross the membrane into the bloodstream, delivering it to the brain within 10 &#8211; 19 seconds  <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBXS.pdf\">(DHHS, 1989)</a>. It then increases the heart rate, blood pressure and overall metabolic rate, decreases appetite, blood flow to the skin and the amount of oxygen the blood can carry to vital organs, causing vasoconstrictions or narrowing of the coronary arteries. It also alters brain waves and functions of the endocrine system and causes skeletal muscle relaxation (<a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBXS.pdf\">DHHS, 1989</a>; RCP, 2000; SG, 2010; <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBXS.pdf\">DHHS, 1988</a>).</p>\n<p>Nicotine levels within the body rapidly increase immediately after the cigarette, and will slowly fall. It has a half-life of 6-8 hours (the time required for any specified property to decrease by half). As a result it will decrease slowly overnight and, a common measure for nicotine addiction is how soon a person requires a cigarette after waking up <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1932883\">(Heatherton et al, 1991)</a>. In large quantities, nicotine is extremely toxic, but acute poisoning is rare, often occurring through accidental swallowing or skin contact with pesticides that contain nicotine <a href=\"http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/nicotine.htm\">(Higa de Landoni, 1991)</a>.Whilst nicotine is the not the substance strongly associated with the smoking-related illness, it is the important compound for addictions and therefore exposure to the thousands of agents which do <a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/publications/smoking-and-young\">(RCP, 1992)</a>.</p>\n<p>Whilst the Royal College of Physicians concluded that &#8216;pure nicotine may be harmful to the foetus in pregnancy but is likely to be far less hazardous than the effects of smoking&#8217; (RCP, 2000), it has been well established beyond all reasonable doubt that smoking in pregnancy is associated with a range of serious problems and adverse effects (RCP, 1992), including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk of miscarriage increasing by almost one-quarter in pregnant smokers</li>\n<li>premature birth &#8211; which has shown to be twice as common in pregnant smokers</li>\n<li>low birth-weight, which can be caused by both maternal AND paternal smoking</li>\n<li>risk of still birth and early neonatal mortality is increased by approximately one-third in babies of smokers.</li>\n<li>complications during labour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these risks are also present in pregnant women who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Children of smokers are also at increased risk of suffering from asthma, as well as other more serious illness, so quitting in pregnancy also has other long term benefits. Babies of parents who smoke are more likely to be admitted to hospital for bronchitis and pneumonia during the first year of life. Evidence shows a women and her unborn child will benefit from quitting even in the last few weeks of pregnancy (SG, 2010).</p>\n<p>In addition to decreasing the risks outlined above, quitting smoking in pregnancy also has significant health benefits for the mother, for example after 20 minutes, pulse returns to normal; after 48 hours, all traces of nicotine is removed from the body and the ability to taste and smell improves; at 2-12 weeks, circulation improves; after 1 year excess risk of a heart attack is reduced by half; after 10 years risk of lung cancer reduces to half that of a continuing smoker and, finally after 15 years, the risk of heart attack falls to the same as someone who has never smoked <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/smokefree\">(NHS, 2015)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures and Trends</h2>\n<h3>Smoking Prevalence</h3>\n<p>The Government&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-tobacco-control-plan-for-england\">Tobacco Control Plan</a>, which was published in 2011, set out a strategy to reduce smoking prevalence and announced a number of targets to be achieved by 2015. A specific target in England was included for reducing smoking during pregnancy from 14% in 2009/10 to less than 11% by the end of 2015, which is likely to be achieved.</p>\n<p>Estimated smoking prevalence in adults aged 18 years in 2014 in Reading is 17.0% &#8211; a figure which, as shown in Figure 1, remains very similar to the national average. This equates to just over 21,000 people (adults) in Reading.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1.

The last survey was completed in 2010 and at the time in England 7% of pregnant women aged 16 to 49 were smokers and 18% were ex-smokers. Smoking prevalence in pregnant women is now published by Public Health England (PHE) as a part of the <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/public-health-outcomes-framework\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> (PHOF) and is produced by the Health and Social Care Information Centre returns on estimated Smoking Status At Time of Delivery (SSATOD).</p>\n<p>Figure 2 below shows the latest annual trend data for SSATOD. As shown, 7.4% of women in Reading were smoking at time of delivery in 2014/15. If we apply this to the number of women resident in Reading giving birth in 2014/15 (3,098), we can estimate that more than 200 of these women were smokers. Whilst England is has shown a consistent downward trend since 2010/11, the trend in Reading marginally fluctuates up and down, with no significant reductions.</p>\n<p>Figure 2. Percentage of mothers smoking time of delivery (SATOD), England and Reading, 2010/11 to 2014/15*</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5080/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.tobaccoprofiles.info/\">Public Health England, Tobacco Control Profile 2015</a>.</p>\n<p>* PHOF data for Reading in 2010/11 and 2012/13 was based on aggregated data for the old Berkshire west PCT. This could therefore be an over/under estimation for the local authority. The data for 2013/14 is based on the women in Reading and should therefore not be directly compared with previous year&#8217;s figures.</p>\n<p>The percentage of women smoking at time of delivery in 2014/15 is significantly better in Reading than the England average (11.4%) and as shown in Figure 3 below, was similar to other local authorities in Berkshire.</p>\n<p>Figure 3. Percentage of mothers smoking time of delivery (SATOD), England and all Berkshire Local Authorities, 2014/15</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5081/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.tobaccoprofiles.info/\">Public Health England, Tobacco Control Profile 2015</a>.</p>\n<p>We also need to consider this in the context of neonatal and infant mortality in Reading, which remains higher than it is nationally. Reducing smoking prevalence in pregnant women and their exposure to second-hand smoke can only have positive effect on the women and their unborn baby, particularly considering the evidence available that links smoking with increased risk of neonatal and infant mortality <a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/publications/smoking-and-young\">(RCP, 1992)</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cost of Smoking</h3>\n<p>In addition to the significant cost to life and health of individuals and families, there are wider implications of smoking, particularly in relation to cost. Action on Smoking and Health&#8217;s [ASH] , a not for profit public health charity established by the Royal College of Physicians, have produced a <a href=\"http://www.ash.org.uk/localtoolkit/R8-SE.html\">tool</a> which estimates the total cost to society (in England) is approximately £13.9bn a year. This includes the cost of treating smoking-related disease caused by smoking in England which is approximately £1.88bn a year. Furthermore, it has been estimated that between £20m and £87.5m each year is spent on treating mothers and their babies (0-12 months) with problems caused by smoking during pregnancy <a href=\"http://phrc.lshtm.ac.uk/papers/PHRC_A3-06_Final_Report.pdf\">(Godrey et al, 2010)</a>.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 outlines the estimated cost of smoking to society for the Reading area. Each year in Reading, it is estimated that smoking costs society £36m, this equates to approximately £1,700 per smoker. The total annual cost to NHS trusts in Reading as result of smoking-related ill health (including passive smoking) is approximately £4.4m. In addition, current and ex-smokers who require care later in life as a result of smoking-related illness, are estimated to cost £2m per year, £1.2m of this is expected to be a direct cost to the local authority and over £850k to individuals who self-fund  <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBXS.pdf\">(DHHS, 1988)</a>.</p>\n<h3>Figure 3.

Updated guidance, including guidance on smoking and quitting smoking in pregnancy and following childbirth, produced by NICE, can be found on NICE&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>NICE (2010) national guidance, <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph26/resources/smoking-stopping-in-pregnancy-and-after-childbirth-1996240366789\">Smoking: Stopping in pregnancy and after childbirth (PH26)</a>, outlines how best to support women to stop smoking in pregnancy and following childbirth. The guidance provides advice on the use of carbon monoxide monitoring to systematically identify all pregnant women who smoke at booking, and on making onward referrals to local stop smoking services.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, there are a there are a number of other national strategies, policy and legislation, as well as local strategies and policies which smoking directly impacts on, these include:</p>\n<h2>National Strategy, policy &amp; legislation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213757/dh_124960.pdf\"><em>Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A Tobacco Control Plan for England</em></a><em>,</em> HM Government (2011)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/41/contents\">National Health Service Act</a> (2006) and <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted\">Health &amp; Social Care Act</a> (2012) &#8211; mandates local authorities to improve life expectancy and reduce health inequalities.</li>\n<li>The Department for Health (2007) <a href=\"http://www.sepho.org.uk/Download/Public/11120/1/DH_081336.pdf\">Implementation Plan for Reducing Inequalities in Infant Mortality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100509080731/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_111749\"><em>A Smokefree Future</em></a>; Department of Health (2010)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reading&#8217;s Health &amp; Wellbeing Strategy</h2>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Health &amp; Wellbeing Strategy has a number of key targets which smoking cessation and tobacco control work contributes to. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promote and protect the health of all communities, particularly those disadvantaged</li>\n<li>Reduce the impact of long term conditions with approaches focused on specific groups</li>\n<li>Promote health-enabling behaviours &amp; lifestyles tailored to the differing needs of communities.</li>\n<li>Joint Strategic Needs Assessment &#8211; contributing to a number of health outcomes in the local population</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Berkshire Tobacco Control Action Plan 2014 &#8211; 2016 also outline key areas of work in Reading and across Berkshire which aims to prevent the uptake of smoking, particularly in younger people. In addition, the support of regulatory work for example ensures that legal restrictions on the sale and promotion of tobacco are enforced, intelligence gathering and sharing and, targets cultural awareness/education and tackling normalisation.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, local smoking cessation services are commissioned by Reading Borough Council. Reading&#8217;s local smoking cessation services, Smokefreelife Berkshire services are provided by <a href=\"http://www.solutions4health.co.uk/\">Solutions 4 Health</a>. Smoking cessation services aim to help people to quit smoking by working with them either on a one to one basis or in small groups to provide smoking cessation advice and support and direct supply of nicotine replacement. In addition to online, telephone and text support, the one to one or face to face services are available in many community settings for example GP surgeries, pharmacy&#8217;s, local shopping centre and antenatal clinics. A mobile unit is also available which can respond to the specific needs of the community, providing smokers with the direct access to experts who can support them to quit.</p>\n<p>While women who smoke are more likely to engage with smoking cessation services during their pregnancy, they are likely to start smoking again after the birth of their child. Services need to be specifically designed and targeted to ensure new parents are targeted and supported to maintain their motivation to quit and education and information provided on the harm and risks to children of second hand smoke.</p>\n<h1>What is this telling us?</h1>\n<p>Smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, unborn babies and children is preventable, as it is with the general smoking population. A significant number of lives could be saved each year if we are able to reduce prevalence both nationally and locally. Smoking causes long-term conditions that significantly affect people&#8217;s everyday lives, putting them at considerable increased risk of illness and early death. This risk extends to babies born to smoking parents, both during pregnancy and after. Quite apart from personal cost, smoking also leads to considerable costs for both health and social care services.</p>\n<p>The most important thing about smoking is it is never too late to quit, with health benefits occurring as quickly as 20 minutes after the last cigarette &#8211; these benefits extend to the unborn baby. Surveys show that over half of smokers would like to stop smoking, but just over a third of these (between 30 &#8211; 40%) will make an annual attempt to quit. Some women find it difficult to admit to smoking during pregnancy, which in itself is an intense experience and, also may not be fully aware of the risks that second hand smoke poses to their unborn babies. Pregnant women and their partners are reliant upon having appropriate support available to them, particularly for smoking cessation attempts <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph26/resources/smoking-stopping-in-pregnancy-and-after-childbirth-1996240366789\">(NICE, 2010)</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to having appropriate smoking cessation services, a focus needs to remain on prevention of uptake, so stopping people from starting. Smoking cessation services also aim to support people to quit long term (Doll et al, 1994).</p>\n<p>Nationally and locally we are still navigating the emerging presence of e-cigarettes, their use as a replacement mechanism for the delivery of nicotine, their use in public places and their use in smoking cessation services. Ongoing monitoring of national guidance and policies will continue to ensure that locally we are up to date with best practice and guidance.</p>\n<h2>What are the key health inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Marmot points out in his 2010 review, <a href=\"http://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources-reports/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review\">Fair Society, Healthy Lives</a>, that tobacco control is central to any strategy to tackle health inequalities with half the difference in life expectancy and the biggest cause of health inequalities between the richest and poorest people in the UK being attributable to smoking. Quitting smoking can allow people to leap the health gap, with the poorest non-smoker having a substantially longer life than the richest smoker and, rich and poor smokers having similar life expectancies. On average, smokers lose 10 years of life in comparison to non-smokers.</p>\n<p>According to the Infant Feeding Survey 2010, pregnant women from unskilled occupation groups are five times more likely to smoke than professionals (20% compared with 4%), and teenagers in England are six times more likely to smoke than older mothers (35% compared with 6%). Under-reporting by pregnant women who smoke is highly likely due to the stigma attached to the behaviour (<a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/infant-feeding-survey-2010\">McAndrew et al. 2012</a>). Infants born to smokers are much more likely to become smokers themselves which creates on-going cycles of health inequalities <a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/passive-smoking-and-children.pdf\">(RCP, 2010)</a>.</p>\n<p>There is also evidence that smoking in disadvantaged communities is more socially acceptable, possibly because there is a higher prevalence of the behaviour. Poorer smokers are more likely to smoke more each day, making them more addicted to nicotine. In addition, richer smokers who attempt to quite are more likely to succeed than poorer smokers (PHE, 2015).</p>\n<p>Smoking is twice as common among routine and manual workers in England in comparison to those in managerial and professional roles. People with mental health disorders are also twice as likely to smoke, and ever more so for those with more severe mental health disorders. People from lesbian, gay and transgender communities are also significantly more likely to smoke as well as people who are unemployed and some black, minority ethnic groups (PHE, 2015).</p>\n<h2>Links to other sections in the JSNA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cardiovascular-disease/\">Cardiovascular Disease</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/smoking-in-young-people/\">Smoking in Young People</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cancer/\">Cancer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/jsna/respiratory\">Respiratory</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/jsna/general-wellbeing\">General Wellbeing</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Action on Smoking and Health [ASH] (2014). <a href=\"http://www.ash.org.uk/information/ash-local-toolkit\"><em>ASH Ready Reckoner</em></a> <em>and LeLan Solutions, September 2014</em> [Online].

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Smoking is the single biggest cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in England, and the most significant thing that a smoker can do to improve their health is to quit smoking. Smoking is particularly significant because of the complications that it causes to those that suffer non-smoking related ill health, as well as those who have a smoking-related illness. In both the short and long term, this has significant implications for the individual, their family and Carers and also, for health and social care services.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Smoking rates in adult men and women have more than halved in the last 30 years. Despite this, it is estimated that there are still 10 million adults who smoke in Great Britain today, and about half of the regular smokers will die prematurely as a result of their smoking (ASH, 2014).</p>\n<p>Smoking kills almost 80,000 people in England each year and is the number one cause of preventable death in the country. Smoking continues to be one of the biggest health challenges and contributes significantly to health inequalities in our communities (PHE, 2015).</p>\n<p>There are more than 4,000 compounds found in tobacco smoke and whilst many have a toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic effect, nicotine is one of the most important chemical compounds that make tobacco products addictive. Whilst addiction is a complex combination of pharmacology, learned behaviour, genetics, and social and environmental factors, cigarettes are a highly efficient system by which nicotine is delivered to the body (ASH 1998; DHHS, 1989; RCP, 2000;). When smoke is drawn in, the large surface area of the lungs helps the nicotine rapidly cross the membrane into the bloodstream, delivering it to the brain within 10 &#8211; 19 seconds. It then increases the heart rate, blood pressure and overall metabolic rate, decreases appetite, blood flow to the skin and the amount of oxygen the blood can carry to vital organs, causing vasoconstrictions or narrowing of the coronary arteries. It also alters brain waves and functions of the endocrine system, and causes skeletal muscle relaxation (ASH 1998; DHHS 1988; DHHS, 1989; DHHS, 2010; RCP, 2000).</p>\n<p>Nicotine levels within the body rapidly increase immediately after the cigarette. It has a half-life of 6-8 hours, meaning that levels of the compound will gradually fall in the body as a result, it will decrease slowly overnight. A common measure for nicotine addiction is how soon a person requires a cigarette after waking up (Heatherton et al, 1991). In large quantities, nicotine is extremely toxic, but acute poisoning is rare (often occurring through accidental swallowing or skin contact with pesticides that contain nicotine) (Higa de Landoni, 1991).Whilst nicotine is the not the substance strongly associated with the smoking-related illness, it is the important compound for addictions and therefore exposure to the thousands of agents which are harmful (RCP, 2000).</p>\n<p>Surveys show that over half of smokers would like to stop smoking and just over a third of these (between 30 &#8211; 40%) will make an annual attempt to quit. Every cigarette damages the lungs of the smoker and, after the age of 35-40 years, for every year of continued smoking, a person loses about 3 months of life expectancy (Doll et al., 1994)</p>\n<p>The benefits of stopping smoking occur within the first hour and, for long term quitters, risks can continue to decline for up to 15 years after they quit. For example, after 20 minutes, pulse returns to normal; after 48 hours, all traces of nicotine is removed from the body and the ability to taste and smell improves; at 2-12 weeks, circulation improves; after 1 year excess risk of a heart attack is reduced by half; after 10 years risk of lung cancer reduces to half that of a continuing smoker and, finally after 15 years, the risk of heart attack falls to the same as someone who has never smoked (NHS, 2015).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures and Trends</h2>\n<p>Lifestyle behaviours are difficult to measure and data is reliant on national surveys from which the results have been applied to local populations to give a local estimate. The Health Survey for England is used to produce estimates of the percentage of the adult population who smoke.</p>\n<p>Estimated smoking prevalence in 2014 in Reading was 17.0% of the population &#8211; a figure which, as shown in Figure 1, remains very similar to the national average. This equates to just over 21,000 adults in Reading.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1. Prevalence of smoking among person aged 18 years, Reading and England, 2010 &#8211; 2014.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6150/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Integrated Household Survey. Analysed by Public Health England.</p>\n<p>Certain health outcomes have been strongly linked with smoking, although the risk for each varies depending on personal characteristics like gender and age. A calculation of the risk is referred to as a &#8216;relative risk factor&#8217; and can be applied to hospital admission data to estimate the number of admissions that are attributable to smoking. This information is presented as a rate per 100,000.</p>\n<h3>Figure 2. Smoking attributable hospital admission, Reading and England, 2009-10 &#8211; 2014-15.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6151/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Local Tobacco Control Profiles (May 2016)</p>\n<p>Relative risk factors can also be applied to mortality data to estimate the number of deaths that are due to smoking. Figure 3 shows that while the rate of deaths attributable to smoking per 100,000 population has decreased since 2007-09, the rate has remained similar to the England average. Between 2012-14, the most recent figures available, 265 deaths per 100,000 population were attributed to smoking.</p>\n<h3>Figure 3. Smoking attributable mortality, Reading and England, 2008-10 to 2012-14.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6152/image3/image/image3_1.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Local Tobacco Control Profiles (May 2016)</p>\n<p>As well as rates of all deaths estimated to be caused by smoking, risk calculations can be further analysed by specific causes of death which are attributable to smoking. The following sections will look at the mortality rates per 100,000 population in Reading and England for lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and stroke. (As the number of deaths from some causes in a relatively small area may be quite low, some of these analyses may lack statistical power and should be interpreted with caution).</p>\n<p>As shown in Figure 4, the rate of deaths from lung cancer in Reading have been fairly consistent and remained similar to the England average since 2001-03. The rate appears to have fallen slightly between 2007-09 and 2011-13, but returned to similar to the England average. Around 50-60 deaths per 100,000 a year in Reading are caused by lung cancer.</p>\n<h3>Figure 4. Deaths from lung cancer all ages, Reading and England, 2001-03 to 2012-14.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6153/image4/image/image4_1.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England (based on ONS source data)</p>\n<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fifth biggest cause of death in the United Kingdom (UK), accounting for 5% of deaths each year. Evidence shows that almost 86% of deaths from COPD could be prevented by quitting smoking, including in non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke (WHO, 2016) Furthermore, those living with COPD have difficulties with breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways and destruction of lung tissue and, in 2013 and 2014, there were over 110,000 emergency hospital admission led by COPD (DH, 2015).</p>\n<p>Figure 5 suggests an inconsistent trend in deaths from COPD in Reading in comparison to England estimates. As the number of deaths in a relatively small area like Reading Borough is likely to be quite small, this may reflect a lack of statistical power and the rate may be disproportionately affected by some unknown factor. Further analysis of COPD evidence is therefore required, but these figures do suggest that the rate of deaths from COPD since 2009-11 has been consistently similar or higher than the England average.</p>\n<h3>Figure 5. Deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all ages, Reading and England, 2001-03 to 2012-14.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6154/image5/image/image5.png\" alt=\"image5 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England (based on ONS source data)</p>\n<p>Figures 6 and 7 also show consistent trends in deaths from heart disease and stroke attributable to smoking for both Reading and England population. Whilst Reading is similar to the England average, for heart disease, between 2010-12 and 2011-13, we saw the first increase in rates recorded since 2007-09. Neither of these is as high as the rates shown earlier for lung cancer and COPD, but these deaths should be considered preventable.</p>\n<h3>Figure 6.

This includes the cost of treating smoking-related disease caused by smoking in England which is approximately £1.88bn a year.</p>\n<p>Figure 8 outlines the estimated cost of smoking to society for the Reading area. Each year in Reading, it is estimated that smoking costs society £36m, which equates to approximately £1,700 per smoker. The total annual cost to NHS trusts in Reading as result of smoking-related ill health (including passive smoking) is approximately £4.4m. In addition, current and ex-smokers who require care later in life as a result of smoking-related illness, are estimated to cost £2m per year. £1.2m of this is expected to be a direct cost to the local authority and over £850k to individuals who self-fund (DHHS, 1988).</p>\n<h3>Figure 8.

Updated guidance from NICE can be found on NICE&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, there are a there are a number of national strategies, policy and legislation, as well as local strategies and policies which smoking directly impacts on. These include:</p>\n<h2>National Strategy, policy &amp; legislation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A Tobacco Control Plan for England, (2011)</li>\n<li>National Health Service Act (2006) and Health &amp; Social Care Act (2012) &#8211; mandates local authorities to improve life expectancy and reduce health inequalities.</li>\n<li>The Department for Health (2007) Implementation Plan for Reducing Inequalities in Infant Mortality</li>\n<li>A Smokefree Future (2010)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reading&#8217;s Health &amp; Wellbeing Strategy</h2>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Health &amp; Wellbeing Strategy has a number of key targets which smoking cessation and tobacco control work contributes to. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To promote and protect the health of all communities, particularly those disadvantaged</li>\n<li>To reduce the impact of long term conditions with approaches focused on specific groups</li>\n<li>To promote health-enabling behaviours &amp; lifestyles tailored to the differing needs of communities.</li>\n<li>Production of a Joint Strategic Needs Assessment &#8211; contributing to a number of health outcomes in the local population</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Berkshire Tobacco Control Action Plan 2014 &#8211; 2016 also outlined key areas of work in Reading and across Berkshire which aim to prevent the uptake of smoking, particularly in younger people. Areas of work involve regulatory work (such as ensuring that legal restrictions on the sale and promotion of tobacco are enforced) intelligence gathering and sharing, targeting cultural awareness/education and tackling normalization.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, local smoking cessation services are commissioned by Reading Borough Council. Smokefreelife Berkshire services are provided by Solutions 4 Health. Smoking cessation services aim to help people to quit smoking by working with them, either on a one to one basis or in small groups, to provide smoking cessation advice and support, and direct supply of nicotine replacement. In addition to online, telephone and text support, the one to one or face to face services are available in many community settings (for example, GP surgeries, pharmacy&#8217;s, local shopping centres and antenatal clinics). A mobile unit is also available which can respond to the specific needs of the community, providing smokers with the direct access to experts who can support them to quit. In 2014/15 the &#8216;cost per quitter&#8217; in Reading decreased to £367.54 from £426.51 in the previous year. This compares favourably with the England average cost of £419.63, which increased from £283.43 in the previous year.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality is preventable and a significant number of lives could be saved each year if we are able to prevent uptake and reduce prevalence both nationally and locally. Long term smoking causes conditions that significantly affect people&#8217;s everyday lives, putting them at increased risk of serious illness and early death. In addition to personal cost to health and wellbeing, smoking also leads to increased costs for health and social care services.</p>\n<p>Surveys show that over half of smokers would like to stop smoking with over a third of these (between 30 &#8211; 40%) will make an annual attempt to quit, and the first benefits of quitting are realized within 20 minutes. Smoking cessation services in Reading appears to provide good value and are likely to contribute to reducing long-term costs of providing health and social care.</p>\n<p>Nationally and locally we are still navigating the emerging presence of e-cigarettes, their use as a replacement mechanism for the delivery of nicotine, their use in public places and their use in smoking cessation services. Ongoing monitoring of national guidance and policies will continue to ensure that locally we are up to date with best practice and guidance.</p>\n<h2>What are the key health inequalities?</h2>\n<p>The most significant differences in life expectancy and health inequalities between the richest and poorest people in the UK are attributable to smoking (Marmot, 2010). Quitting smoking can allow people to leap the health gap, with the poorest non-smoker having a substantially longer life than the richest smoker and, rich and poor smokers having similar life expectancies. On average, smokers lose 10 years of life in comparison to non-smokers.</p>\n<p>Smoking in disadvantaged communities is more socially acceptable, possibly because of higher prevalence. Poorer smokers are more likely to smoke more each day, making them more addicted to nicotine. In addition, richer smokers who attempt to quite are more likely to succeed than poorer smokers (NHS, 2015).</p>\n<p>Smoking is twice as common among routine and manual workers in England in comparison to those in managerial and professional roles. People with mental health disorders are also twice as likely to smoke, and ever more so for those with more severe mental health disorders. People from lesbian, gay and transgender communities are also significantly more likely to smoke as well as people who are unemployed and some black, minority ethnic groups (NHS, 2015).</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Action on Smoking and Health [ASH] (2014).

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>This summary has been produced to accompany the 2017 Berkshire Sexual Health Needs Assessment. It aims to provide an overview of the key findings from the needs assessment relating to: the current sexual health of people resident in Reading; and the sexual health services used by people resident in Reading. The needs assessment and accompanying summary will be used to identify priority areas of need; to identify what is working well and where improvements can be made, in order to inform the commissioning of local sexual health services in Reading.</p>\n<p>The current main provider of sexual health services in Reading is The Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH). They provide an integrated service covering both Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) related care and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) related care. The current provider contract will end on the 31st March 2020.</p>\n<p>National commentaries around the current sexual health commissioning arrangements express concern around their fragmented nature with commissioning split between local authorities, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), and NHS England. There is concern that services are not accessible to all, particularly those at greatest risk; that contracting problems are arising through patients attending services out-of-are; that there is a lack of clinical expertise both in service delivery and commissioning. There is also a general increase in demand for services occurring at the same time as budgetary restrictions.</p>\n<h2>Reading&#8217;s population</h2>\n<p>Reading has a total population of 161,739 (ONS, 2016). A number of population groups have been highlighted as been at a higher than average risk of poor sexual health outcomes. It is not always possible to count and map the numbers of people from these groups. However, we can estimate that in Reading there are;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>12,166 females and 11,716 males ages 15 to 24</li>\n<li>56,609 people from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds\n<ul>\n<li>Reading has an ethnically diverse population with just over 60% coming from White British backgrounds</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>6,428 living in the most deprived areas of Reading</li>\n<li>613 users of adult specialist substance misuse services</li>\n<li>1,016 men who have sex with men (MSM)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Reading&#8217;s population structure is compared to the overall population structure for England, there is a higher proportion of people age 20 to 44 living in Reading; and a lower proportion of those aged 45 and over. In terms of predicted change in population size, we can expect an increase across all age groups and, in particular, in those aged 45 and over.</p>\n<h2>Reproductive health</h2>\n<p>All- age conception rates in Reading are higher than national and regional averages and have shown a slight increase in recent years. There has been a large percentage decrease (65%) in the rate of teenage pregnancies between 1998 and 2015. Current rates are comparable to national and regional averages. There has also been a steady decrease in the rates of conceptions to under 16 year olds.</p>\n<p>Over 20% of all age conceptions in Reading lead to abortion. The percentage of conceptions leading to abortion Reading is comparable to the national average and higher than the regional average. We can also look at the number of abortions as a rate of the total female population aged between 15 and 44. The abortion rate in Reading is higher than the national and regional rates.</p>\n<p>Women under the age of 18 are much more likely to have an abortion than average. The percentage of under 18 conceptions in Reading which lead to abortion is around 60% and is higher than the national and regional averages although this is not a statistically significant difference. The percentage of under 18 conceptions leading to abortion in Reading has significantly increase overtime: a pattern that has been seen nationally. This is suggestive that the numbers of unplanned pregnancies are decreasing at a slower rate than planned pregnancies.</p>\n<p>The birth rate in Reading is approximately 70 per 1,000 females aged 15 to 44 and is higher than national and regional averages (approx. 60 per 1,000).</p>\n<p>Reading residents have contact with sexual health services for Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) related care significantly less than the national and regional averages. When looking at the key 15 to 24 year old age group, both males and females aged 15 to 24 from Reading are significantly less likely to attend sexual health services for SRH care than national and regional averages with male attendances been particularly low.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of contacts made by Reading residents occur in clinics located in Berkshire. The majority of those choosing to go out of area go to St Mary&#8217;s in Westminster (1.6% of all Reading residents&#8217; contacts for SRH related care).</p>\n<p>Just 4% of all contacts made by Reading residents are made by males. This is lower than the national and regional average of 12%. As a proportion of all SRH-related contacts made by females from Reading, a higher proportion of contacts are made by those aged less than 25 than are made by this age group on average nationally and regionally. When we look at female SRH-related contacts as a proportion of the total population aged 13 to 54, just 6% of the female 25 year plus population from Reading attend services compared to 15% of this age group on average nationally. 50% of the female under 25 year old population from Reading attend services compared to 60% nationally.</p>\n<p>Around 50% of SRH-related contacts are for contraceptive care. This is followed by attendance for sexual health advice with make up just fewer than 50% of contacts. One contact may be made up of more than one activity so it is likely that those attending for contraception will also be coded under sexual health advice.</p>\n<p>Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) is available via GPs and via the integrated sexual health service. Total rates of Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) prescribing across both GP and SRH services are higher than national and regional averages for females resident in Reading. There has been a non-significant increase in prescribing between 2014 and 2015. The vast majority of LARC is prescribed in GP Practices which is the pattern seen nationally and regionally. However, the increase in LARC prescribing described above appears to be driven by a significant increase in prescribing in SRH services with no change seen in prescribing in GP Practices.</p>\n<p>79% of contraception prescribed in South Reading CCG, and 77% of contraception prescribed in North and West Reading CCG is for short-acting hormonal contraception. LARC prescribing as a rate of population is lower than the Berkshire average in South Reading CCG; both short-acting hormonal contraception and LARC prescribing is higher in North and West Reading CCG than the Berkshire average. It should be noted that the Berkshire rates are skewed downwards due to particularly low rates of prescribing in Slough.</p>\n<p>When LARC provided in GP Practices (including the contraceptive injection) is broken down by LARC type, it can be seen that the most common LARC used by patients registered at North and West Reading and South Reading CCGs is the contraceptive implant followed by the contraceptive injection. There are higher than average rates of prescribing of the IUS in North and West Reading CCG.</p>\n<h2>Sexually transmitted infections</h2>\n<p>In 2016 rates of new STI diagnoses in Reading in 2016 were higher than the national and regional averages. Rates have showed a decreasing trend both nationally and regionally which has also been mirrored in Reading between 2013 and 2016.</p>\n<p>Rates of all-age chlamydia diagnoses are similar to the national average in Reading and higher than the Regional average. They have shown a significant decrease over recent years. Diagnosis is most common in people aged less than 25, particularly amongst females in this age group. However, diagnosis rates are increasing amongst those aged 25 and over nationally and in the South East Region.</p>\n<p>Rates of newly diagnosis HIV in Reading are higher than they are for the South East Region and comparable to the national average. Rates have shown a decline nationally and regionally. A non-statistically significant downward trend can also be seen in the rates of new diagnosis in Reading over recent years with rates previously been higher than the national average. HIV prevalence rates in Reading are higher than national and regional averages. Although not significant, and upward trend can be seen in the prevalence rates indicating an improvement in HIV care and an increasing life expectancy for those with the condition.</p>\n<p>Rates of gonorrhoea diagnosis in Reading were higher than the national average in 2015 after a significant increase in rates. In 2016 rates dropped back in line with the national average but still remain higher than the regional average.</p>\n<p>A non-significant increasing trend is seen in syphilis diagnosis rates in Reading between 2013 and 2016. This mirrors the increasing trend seen nationally and regionally. Rates in Reading in 2016 are comparable to national and regional averages.</p>\n<p>Diagnoses of genital warts and herpes have been decreasing nationally. A significant change has not yet been detected in the Berkshire local authorities. However, a slight non-significant downward trend can be seen in the diagnosis of genital warts in Reading since 2013. Rates of genital warts and herpes in Reading in 2016 were higher than national and regional averages and have been so consistently over recent years.</p>\n<p>When looking for inequalities within STI diagnosis rates, data has been aggregated across all Berkshire local authorities due to small numbers at individual local authority level. This analysis shows that types of diagnosis differ between males and females with males receiving more diagnoses of gonorrhoea, syphilis and genital warts and females receiving more diagnoses of chlamydia and herpes. Diagnoses are most common in younger age groups and peak in the 25 to 34 age band. More Gay and Bisexual men are diagnosed with an STI than would be expected given the relative population size. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) women make up a very small proportion of diagnoses. People from &#8216;Black&#8217; or &#8216;Other&#8217; ethnic backgrounds are more likely to be diagnosed with an STI than would be expected given the relative population size.</p>\n<p>During 2016, First attendance rates for STI related care for people resident in Reading were approximately 10,000 per 100,000 resident population. This is the second highest attendance rate out of the six Berkshire local authorities.</p>\n<p>When looking for inequalities amongst first attendance for STI-related care, data has been aggregated across all Berkshire local authorities due to small numbers at individual local authority level. Gay and bi-sexual men are more likely to attend for STI-related care then would be expected given their relative population size. This is a similar pattern to that which we see in the numbers of new STI diagnoses. Also similar to the pattern in the diagnosis data is the fact that people from &#8216;Black&#8217; and &#8216;Other&#8217; ethnic backgrounds are overrepresented given the relative population sizes of these groups.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of residents from Reading attending clinics for STI related care attend clinics within Berkshire (96%). People from Reading who go out of area for STI related care are most likely to attend the Dean Street Clinic in Westminster (0.8% of all Reading residents&#8217; attendances for STI related care).</p>\n<p>Around 78% of Reading residents who attend a clinic for STI related care receive a sexual health screen at their first attendance. Females are slightly more likely to be tested then males.</p>\n<p>When looking at data aggregated across Berkshire, people identifying as heterosexual are more likely to be tested for an STI than those identifying as Gay, Bisexual, or who do not specify with rates of uptake highest in heterosexual males. Males across all other groups are less likely to be tested for STIs than females. People from Black ethnic backgrounds are significantly less likely to take up an STI test (58%). These patterns are a reversal of what we can see in both the first attendance rates and in the STI diagnosis data: although Gay and Bisexual men and people from Black ethnic backgrounds are over-represented in the attendance and STI diagnosis rates, they are less likely to receive an STI test at their first attendance for STI related care. This means that it is more likely that people within these groups have an undiagnosed STI.</p>\n<h2>Sexual health services</h2>\n<p>In the West of Berkshire level 3 STI and level 2 SRH services are provided as an integrated service by the Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH). The service is characterised by a &#8216;hub-and-spoke&#8217; model. The hub is based in Reading (The Florey Clinic) and spoke services operate at West Berkshire Community Hospital and Wokingham Community Hospital. Level 2 services operate at Whitley Health and Social Services in Reading. Young people&#8217;s services called Healthpoints also operate out of the following locations;</p>\n<p>Reading &#8211; Reading Adviza (Contraception only)<br />\nReading &#8211; Prospect Park School<br />\nReading &#8211; Reading College<br />\nReading &#8211; Whitley Health and Social Services Centre<br />\nWokingham &#8211; Woodley Centre Surgery<br />\nWokingham -Wokingham Community Hospital<br />\nWest Berkshire &#8211; Newbury College<br />\nWest Berkshire &#8211; Waterside Youth Centre</p>\n<p>In 2016/17 15,119 attendance episodes at RBH integrated sexual health services were made by Reading residents which is an increase from 14,835 in 2015/16. Reading residents make up 53% of all attendance episodes at RBH integrated sexual health services made by Berkshire residents. The majority of these (8,341) were first episodes. 71% of episodes were for STI related care.</p>\n<p>STI-related care episodes can be further analysed by diagnosis/condition/disease and services provided. The data does not currently provide details of the activity recorded against SRH related care episodes so we are not able to further analyse these.</p>\n<p>2,886 STI diagnoses were made at first attendances at RBH sexual health services where the patient was a Reading resident with (50% of all diagnoses made in RBH clinics amongst Berkshire residents). The number of diagnoses made has decreased from 3,322 in 2015/16. This is the pattern we are seeing at a national level in the new STI diagnosis data. Numbers of all diagnoses have decreased with the exception of chlamydia for which numbers have increased from 482 to 576 between 2015/16 and 2016/17. This increase may be due to the decrease of the NCSP (see below) meaning that a higher proportion of people are now been tested for chlamydia in sexual health services. The most common diagnosis amongst Reading residents attending RBH clinics is for chlamydia (20%) followed by genital warts (17%).</p>\n<p>20,226 services were provided at first and follow-up attendances at RBH sexual health services where the patient was a Reading resident (52% of all services provided in RBH clinics to all Berkshire residents). The numbers of services provided has decreased slightly from 20,236 in 2015/16. This decrease is driven by a decrease in services provided at follow-up attendances with an increase seen in the numbers of services provided at first attendances. This could be indicating an increase in the efficiency of the service: providing more services at first attendances is reducing the need for follow-up appointments. It could also be reflective of the decrease in STI diagnoses at first appointments which is reducing the need for treatment and follow-up. For first episodes, there has been some increase in all services provided and a decrease in the numbers coded as &#8216;HIV test &#8211; not appropriate&#8217;. When testing activity at first attendance is grouped by STI type, it shows an increase in testing for all conditions between 2015/16 and 2016/17. For follow-up episodes, there has been some decrease across all services provided between 2015/16 and 2016/17 with the exception of Partner Notification.</p>\n<p>When we look at the proportion of episodes of care at RBH sexual health services that are coming in from out of area (Berkshire), just over 400 attendances at RBH clinics in Reading for SRH related care are made by people coming in from out of area with the majority coming from Oxfordshire or an &#8216;Unknown&#8217; local authority. 3,882 attendances at all RBH sexual health services for STI-related care were made by people coming in from out of area: the majority were from South Oxfordshire, Basingstoke and Deane, or from elsewhere in the UK (not England and Wales).</p>\n<p>Benchmarking of STI testing data is shown in Public Health England reports. Rates of testing for all STIs (excluding chlamydia &lt;25) in Reading are higher than the national and regional average. Rates of testing in Reading are increasing over time in line with the national trend. Although testing rates are increasing, positivity rates are decreasing in Reading, again, following the national trend but being significantly lower than the national and regional averages.</p>\n<p>HIV testing coverage as a proportion of those attending sexual health services for STI related care is decreasing in Reading and is lower than the national and regional averages. This decrease in testing and lower total coverage seems to be mainly driven by low and decreasing testing amongst women attending services. Testing coverage is increasing amongst males, and amongst MSM with testing amongst MSM being higher than the national and regional averages. 46% of new diagnoses of HIV in Reading are diagnosed at a late diagnosis stage. This figure is similar to the national average and had remained relatively static over recent years.</p>\n<p>The National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) which aims to test sexually-active people under the age of 25 was decommissioned in Berkshire from 31st March 2016. Chlamydia screening coverage in Reading during was lower than national and regional averages for the first time having been historically higher than these averages but decreasing each year. Across Berkshire, the majority of tests that are taken are; taken by females (72%); taken by people aged 20-24 (67%); taken in sexual health services (75%). Positivity rates in Berkshire are 7% and tests are more likely to be positive; amongst males: amongst those aged 15 to 19; when taken in sexual health services. This is reflected in the significant decrease in Reading of the chlamydia detection rate (diagnoses per 100,000 population aged 15 to 24) which is now lower also lower than the national average.</p>\n<p>Emergency Hormonal Contraception (EHC) is available via GPs, pharmacies, and via the integrated sexual health service. Data available from pharmacies as recorded in the &#8216;PharmOutcomes&#8217; system appears to be incomplete across some Berkshire local authorities; 153 prescriptions were recorded in Reading pharmacies in 2016/17. Rates of EHC provided to Reading residents in SRH services are the same as national averages, and higher than regional averages. Prescriptions of EHC in GP Practices for patients registered in both North and West Reading CCG and South Reading CCG are comparable to the Berkshire average. However, these two CCGs have the highest rate of prescribing out of the seven Berkshire CCGs with the highest rate of prescribing coming from South Reading CCG.</p>\n<p>Support for those living with HIV is provided by Thames Valley Positive Support; a charitable organisation with bases in Reading and Slough. They support approximately 25 people across Berkshire per month. The numbers of people supported by local authority varies with more people supported in Reading and Slough. Thames Valley Positive Support also provide a service for those engaging in Chemsex.</p>\n<p>A Termination of Pregnancy Service (TOPS) is provided by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service and is commissioned by the Reading CCGs. Percentages of repeat abortions amongst females aged less than 25% trend towards been higher than national and regional averages in Reading. However, numbers are too small to say that this is a significant difference.</p>\n<p>The nearest Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) is based in Slough and commissioned by NHS England. Trust House is a charitable organisation based in Reading offering specialist support services for people affected by rape and sexual abuse in Berkshire.</p>\n<p>The Safe Sex Berkshire website is available as a central, web-based information resource on sexual health services across Berkshire. There were a total of 34,861 visits to the website during 2016/16 with a monthly average of 2,905 visits. Visits peaked around the times of promotional activity. A user survey showed that the majority of users of the site are; aged 15 to 24, are female, are from White ethnic backgrounds, and visit the site for advice around contraception and STIs. 80% of those who access the site do so from mobile devices so work is currently underway to improve the look and feel of the site for those using these media.</p>\n<h2>Key points</h2>\n<h3>Population key points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading has an ethnically diverse population with people from BAME backgrounds known to be at an increased risk of poor sexual health</li>\n<li>Reading has a high proportion of resident who are aged 20 to 44 with those in younger age groups known to be particularly vulnerable to poor sexual health</li>\n<li>Reading has a high number of people from groups that are known to have some of the poorest sexual health outcomes including MSM and adults who misuse substances</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reproductive health key points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A dramatic decrease in teenage pregnancy highlights the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy as an exemplary sexual health promotion programme and a caution against subsequent complacency in this area in order to keep rates of unplanned pregnancy low\n<ul>\n<li>Although not statistically different to national and regional averages, the increase proportion of under 18 conceptions leading to abortion suggests that there are groups of young women who are remaining vulnerable to unplanned pregnancy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The abortion rate is higher than the national average in Reading\n<ul>\n<li>Repeat abortions in under 25 year olds are higher than national average although this is not a statistically significant difference</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s higher than average birth rate and large population of reproductive age indicates a higher than average need for sexual and reproductive health care\n<ul>\n<li>The trend towards females giving birth at older ages highlights the importance for women to continue to use contraception until after the menopause</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Despite this higher level of potential need, people from Reading are less likely than national and regional averages to attend sexual health services for SRH related care\n<ul>\n<li>This is true across all age groups and is particularly marked in the low rates of males attending services\n<ul>\n<li>Potential reasons for low attendance amongst males are:\n<ul>\n<li>Provision of condoms to young men outside of SRH services could reduce the numbers attending SRH services</li>\n<li>Some service models may not attract males</li>\n<li>Some integrated service models may record certain contraceptive models only as part of the GUM data set</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Just 6% of the female population who are aged 25 and over are attending services for SRH related care\n<ul>\n<li>RBH not commissioned to provide LARC to those aged 25 and over</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Total Rates of LARC prescribing are higher than national and regional averages and are increasing\n<ul>\n<li>LARC prescriptions higher in GP Practices than in SRH services\n<ul>\n<li>Though increase in prescribing driven by increase in SRH service prescribing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>GP prescribing of short-acting hormonal contraception and LARC as a rate of the population is higher than the Berkshire average in North and West Reading CCG\n<ul>\n<li>LARC prescribing is lower than average in South Reading CCG</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STI key points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Diagnosis rates of all new STIs are higher than national and regional averages in Reading potential driven by higher rates of genital warts and herpes;

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Reading has a diverse school age population with a much higher than average proportion of children from black and minority ethnicities and a higher proportion whose first language is not English. Most primary age children attend a school within Reading Borough that is rated &#8216;outstanding&#8217; or &#8216;good&#8217; by Ofsted. Secondary school aged children are less likely to attend an &#8216;outstanding&#8217; or &#8216;good&#8217; school and more likely to attend a school outside of Reading Borough. Although performance against key performance indicators on attainment at Key Stage 4 show that overall attainment in Reading is better than the England average, this does not reflect the wide disparity in attainment levels for children at this stage of their education in Reading. In particular, children from more deprived families appear to be much less likely to achieve in line with their peers.<br />\nNational and local policies focus on setting higher expectations for all pupils, improving school and teaching quality. In its strategy, Reading Borough Council has set out clear ambitions for strong leadership, high quality teaching, a wide-ranging curriculum meeting a broad range of needs, and an inclusive approach that values the diversity of its pupils and supports the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>In 2015/16, Reading provided 13,597 places at 39 primary schools, 7,202 places at 10 secondary schools, 244 places at 4 special schools and 94 places at a pupil referral unit. In addition, there are 10 independent schools within Reading borough, attended by 2,887 pupils. Most secondary places were in academies (5,707 pupils 79% of the total, attending eight academy schools), while most primary places were in community schools (9,212 pupils, 68% of the total, attending 23 community schools).</p>\n<p>On 31st August 2016, 87% of primary school places and 59% of secondary school places were in a school with an Ofsted ranking of &#8216;Outstanding&#8217; or &#8216;Good&#8217;. 12% of primary school places and 41% of secondary school places were ranked &#8216;Requires Improvement&#8217; or &#8216;Inadequate&#8217;. While rankings for primary schools have improved in the last 5 years (55% of places were in schools ranked &#8216;Outstanding&#8217; or &#8216;Good&#8217; in 2011), rankings for secondary schools have got worse in the last five years (77% of places were in schools ranked &#8216;Outstanding&#8217; or &#8216;Good&#8217; in 2011) (published on <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/ofsted#!/vizhome/Dataview/Viewregionalperformanceovertime\">Tableau</a>, accessed December 2016).</p>\n<p>School Census data published in January 2016 indicate that 87% of primary school age residents in Reading were attending a primary school within the Borough. 97% of those attending primary schools in Reading also lived in the borough, with only 385 pupils travelling to Reading primary schools from neighbouring areas. The picture is different for secondary schools, where only 63% of secondary school age residents attended a school in the borough and 37% (2,733 pupils) attended schools in neighbouring areas. 82% of those attending schools in Reading also lived in the borough, with 995 pupils travelling to Reading secondary schools from neighbouring areas.</p>\n<p>Where parents of school aged children are in receipt of certain benefits, their children may be eligible for free school meals. The level of achievement by children who are eligible for free school meals is often used as a proxy indicator to show how well schools support children from lower income families. In January 2016 around 15% of primary school pupils and 13% of secondary school pupils were eligible for free school meals, a similar percentage to the national average. Almost 50% of those in special schools and 55% of those in Reading&#8217;s pupil referral unit were eligible for free school meals, these percentages were both higher than the national averages of 37% and 41%.</p>\n<p>54% of pupils in primary schools in Reading and 49% of secondary pupils were from a minority ethnic group, compared to national averages of 31% in primary school and 28% in secondary school. 35% of primary school pupils and 26% of secondary school pupils in Reading were identified as speaking a language other than English as their first language, compared to national averages of 20% and 16%.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: Ethnic group of primary school children in Reading (January 2016)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6856/Figure-1/image/Fig_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Education (2016); Schools, pupils and their characteristics (January 2016).</p>\n<h3>Figure 2: Ethnic group of secondary school children in Reading (January 2016)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6857/Figure-2/image/Fig_2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Education (2016); Schools, pupils and their characteristics (January 2016).</p>\n<p>In January 2016 average class sizes in Key Stages 1 and 2 were similar to the national average at around 28 pupils per class.</p>\n<p>In January 2016 there were a smaller percentage of children with SEN in Reading schools than the national average &#8211; 20% of all pupils in Reading (including 244 in special schools, 1.8% of the total), compared to 24% (of whom 2.3% went to special schools). In primary school aged children, more than a third in Reading (35.6%) primarily require support with speech, language and communication and around a quarter (23%) have a specific, moderate or severe learning disability. In secondary school aged children, the most significant primary needs were related to social, emotional and mental health (28%) and specific, moderate or severe learning disability (32%). For those attending special schools, most had a severe learning disability (40%), social, emotional or mental health (33%), or an autistic spectrum disorder (16.8%) as their primary need (figure 3).</p>\n<h3>Figure 3: Primary type of need for Reading pupils with identified SEN needs (January 2016)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6858/Figure-3/image/Fig_3_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 3 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Education (2016); Schools, pupils and their characteristics (January 2016).</p>\n<p>The overall absence rate for the year in both primary and secondary schools in Reading decreased from 4.2% in Autumn 2014 to 4.0% in Autumn 2015.

In Reading this is driven by a low percentage of &#8216;authorised&#8217; absence (this could include absence because of illness, medical or dental appointments, religious observance, or study leave; absence of children by gypsy and traveller families when they are known to be travelling; and, in exception circumstances, children who have been excluded but not yet able to continue their education elsewhere). The level of &#8216;unauthorised absence&#8217; (where no reason is provided or the school is not satisfied with the reason provided, where holiday has been taken without the agreement of the school, or where pupils have arrived in school after registration has closed) (see figure 4) was similar to the average for the group. &#8216;Persistent absence&#8217; (the percentage of pupils who missed more than 38 sessions in the Autumn and Spring terms) was also similar to the average (4.0% in Reading compared to 4.1% overall)</p>\n<h3>Figure 4: Comparison of absence rates in Reading and similar areas</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6859/Figure-4/image/Fig_4.png\" alt=\"Figure 4 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Education, Pupil absence in schools in England: Autumn 2014 and Spring 2015</p>\n<p>In 2016, 2039 pupils at Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) were assessed by teacher assessment and 69% (1047 pupils) were considered to have reached at least the expected standard, slightly higher than the national average of 67%. A higher percentage of girls (76%, compared to 63% of boys) and higher percentages of pupils from Black and White ethnic groups (73% of pupils from Black ethnic groups and 71% of White ethnic groups) achieved the expected standard. We should consider that, when broken down in this way, the number of pupils in each group may be too small to be sure that the trends have not occurred by chance. In addition, each ethnic grouping is likely to include children from a range of different ethnic, cultural and social backgrounds, and overall performance may reflect other factors not described in these data.</p>\n<p>The percentage of early years pupils with a first language other than English achieving the expected standard is higher than the national average (70% in Reading compared to 61% nationally) and almost equal to the percentage of pupils with English as a first language (71%).<br />\nThe percentage of early years pupils eligible for free school meals achieving the expected standard is much lower than the average in Reading (55%), but slightly higher than the national average for this group (52%). Similarly, the number of pupils receiving SEN support is much lower than the Reading average (28%), but equal to the national average for this group (28%).</p>\n<p>At Key Stage 1 in the same period, the percentages of pupils reaching the expected standards were similar to the national average for reading, writing and mathematics, but slightly below the national average for science. The percentages of pupils reaching the higher standards were higher than the national average in reading, writing and mathematics. Higher percentages of girls than boys met both the expected and higher levels, with a particularly low percentage of boys achieving either level in writing compared to girls. These trends are also reflected in the national picture. Breaking down achievement of expected standards by gender and ethnic group (Figure 5) indicates lower numbers of boys from White ethnic groups achieving expected standards, especially in writing. There were also lower percentages of boys and girls with mixed ethnic heritage who met the expected standard for writing. As above, great care needs to be taken when considering results broken down by ethnic group.</p>\n<h3>Figure 5: % of pupils achieving expected levels of achievement at Key Stage 1 by gender and ethnic group in Reading in 2016</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6860/Figure-5/image/Fig_5.png\" alt=\"Figure 5 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Table showing GCSE attainment by Pupil Cohort Group in Reading and England 2015\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>GCSE attainment by pupil cohort group</th>\n<th>Reading &#8211; % achieved 5 or more A*-C GCSEs or equivalent, including English and maths</th>\n<th>Reading &#8211; Attainment gap with other pupils</th>\n<th>England &#8211; % achieved 5 or more A*-C GCSEs or equivalent, including English and maths</th>\n<th>England &#8211; Attainment gap with other pupils</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>All</th>\n<td>57.5%</td>\n<td>&#8211;</td>\n<td>53.8%</td>\n<td>&#8211;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Disadvantaged (eligible for free school meals in the previous 6 years or looked after by the Local Authority for more than 6 months)</th>\n<td>37.5%</td>\n<td>37.5%</td>\n<td>36.8%</td>\n<td>28.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Eligible for free school meals</th>\n<td>23.8%</td>\n<td>40.1%</td>\n<td>33.3%</td>\n<td>27.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Receiving SEN support</th>\n<td>27.3%</td>\n<td>40.8%</td>\n<td>23.5%</td>\n<td>44.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>SEN support with statement</th>\n<td>13.6%</td>\n<td>54.5%</td>\n<td>8.8%</td>\n<td>55.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>English as an additional language</th>\n<td>58.00%</td>\n<td>-0.6%</td>\n<td>57.5%</td>\n<td>1.0%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Department for Education (2016); Revised GCSE and equivalent results: 2014 to 2015</p>\n<h3>Figure 6: Percentage of pupils in key groups at the end of Key Stage 4 achieving 5 or more A*-C grades for GCSE or equivalent, including English and Maths GCSEs.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 6\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6861/Figure-6/image/Fig_6.png\" alt=\"Figure 6 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Education (2016), Revised GCSE and equivalent results: 2014 to 2015.</p>\n<p>Attainment by pupils entitled to free school meals (a proxy indicator used to measure attainment of those who are more deprived) is lower in Reading than elsewhere.

In Reading the percentage of children eligible for free school meals who attained 5 or more GCSEs A*-C including Maths and English fell from 30.7% in 2013/14 to 23.7% in 2014/15. The gap in attainment between this group and all other pupils is also wider in Reading than nationally. This has been identified as a priority area for local improvement. Attainment by pupils categorised as disadvantaged using the broader definition (eligible for free school meals in the previous 6 years or looked after by the Local Authority for more than 6 months) is slightly higher than the national average, but, again, the attainment gap between this group and all other pupils is wider than nationally.</p>\n<h3>Figure 7: No of all pupils and disadvantaged pupils at Key Stage 4 by school type and admission policy 2014/15.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 7\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6862/Figure-7/image/Fig_7.png\" alt=\"Figure 7 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: KS4 Attainment 1, Department for Education</p>\n<p>In 2014/15 the largest number of pupils attended schools with comprehensive admission policies (922 pupils, 61% of all pupils in Reading schools and 80% of those supported by the Local Authority), of whom the majority attended mainstream academies (48%, 439 pupils). 322 Key Stage 4 pupils were classified as disadvantaged, of whom 303 (94%) attended schools with comprehensive admission policies. 127 (39%) disadvantaged pupils attended mainstream academies (including 4 who attended a school with selective admission policy), 76 (24%) attended a sponsor-led academy, 45 (14%) attended a foundation school, 42 (13%) attended a voluntary-aided Roman Catholic school, 17 (5%) attended a UTC and 13 (4%) attended special schools.</p>\n<p>220 pupils attended academies with selective admission policies, accounting for 15% of all pupils in Reading and 19% of those supported by the Local Authority.

None met the criteria for classification as disadvantaged.</p>\n<h3>Figure 8: Total No. Key Stage 4 pupils, No. attaining 5 A*-C GCSEs including Maths and English by School Type and Admission Policy</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 8\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6863/Figure-8/image/Fig_8.png\" alt=\"Figure 8 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: KS4 Attainment 1, Department for Education</p>\n<p>60% of all KS4 pupils and 68% of KS4 pupils who attended schools supported by the Local Authority who attained 5 or more GCSEs graded A*-C including Maths and English attended mainstream academies (454 pupils). About half of these attended a school with a selective admission policy and about half attended a school with a comprehensive admission policy. 346 Key Stage 4 pupils attended an independent school. Although only 26% of Key Stage 4 pupils in independent schools attained 5 or more GCSEs graded A*-C including Maths and English, this reflects a mixed picture. A higher than average number of pupils at two independent schools attained 5 or more A*-C GCSEs including Maths and English (82%), a number of schools did not enter pupils for GCSE or equivalent qualifications and are therefore reported as 0%, and in some cases the numbers are too small to be published without risk of pupils being identified. Other than independent schools that did not enter pupils for GCSEs or equivalent, schools with the lowest percentage attainment also had the highest number of disadvantaged pupils (figure 9).</p>\n<h3>Figure 9: No. disadvantaged pupils by quartile of school performance against % of all pupils in school that attained 5 or more GCSEs including Maths and English, Reading, 2015.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 9\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6864/Figure-9/image/Fig_9.png\" alt=\"Figure 9 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: KS4 Attainment 1, Department for Education (excludes schools with numbers too small to be shared and those independent schools that did not enter pupils for GCSEs or equivalents.

The number of children in each ethnicity grouping is relatively small and it is not clear whether the comparison with national attainment is statistically robust. (For example, the analysis above includes the results of just 19 Chinese pupils.) These trends are likely to be related to an external factor that may be more common amongst certain people in Reading with an Asian ethnicity (this could be something like higher average income, for example, or parents&#8217; level of education). It should be noted that similar trends in attainment by ethnic group were seen nationally.</p>\n<h3>Figure 10: Percentage of pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 achieving 5 or more A*-C grades for GCSE or equivalent, including English and Maths GCSEs.</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 10\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6865/Figure-10/image/Fig_10.png\" alt=\"Figure 10 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Education (2016), Revised GCSE and equivalent results: 2014 to 2015.</p>\n<p>The percentage of KS4 pupils attaining 5 or more GCSEs A*-C or equivalent in Reading has remained slightly above the national average since 2012/13, and was similar to the average in the previous three years. However, this overall picture represents a diverse range of experiences and attainment levels for children at this stage of their education in Reading. In particular, children from more deprived families appear to be much less likely to achieve in line with their peers. Performance against indicators of GCSE attainment is much lower amongst schools with a higher proportion of pupils classified as disadvantaged. This performance does not reflect attainment by pupils who attend independent schools in Reading, many of which have selective admission policies and charge termly fees.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>In March 2016, the Department for Education published its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508422/DfE_Strategy_overview.pdf\">strategy</a> for 2015-2020 with three stated overarching goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safety and wellbeing of pupils &#8211; ensuring that pupils are protected from physical, sexual and emotional abuse, maximising potential for learning, development and growth, focusing on groups of children that face greater challenges &#8211; for instance, those in care or with poor mental health.</li>\n<li>Education excellence everywhere &#8211; improvements in school standards and pupils&#8217; achievements, irrespective of location, prior attainment, or economic and social background.</li>\n<li>Prepared for adult life &#8211; recognising the importance of skills and character (persistence, integrity, curiosity, being able to apply knowledge).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The strategy sets out plans for 12 strategic priorities to achieve these goals, focusing on driving performance, improving inspection and increasing the number and reach of high quality schools.</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Reading-First-Raising-Attainment-Strategy-2015-2018-Public-Consultation-draft.pdf\">Reading First &#8211; educational ambition and achievement strategy 2015-2018</a> sets out specific targets for pupil attainment at each key stage; expectations that all pupils&#8217; achievement, including those considered more deprived, who are in care, or who have special educational needs, is better than their peers nationally; and that both the Local Authority and schools make improvements and achieve the highest standards. The strategy includes clear ambitions for strong leadership, high quality teaching, a wide-ranging curriculum meeting a broad range of needs, and an inclusive approach that values the diversity of its pupils and supports the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Commentators have suggested a number of factors that may affect deprived children&#8217;s attainment at school. A 2007 report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that children in &#8216;advantaged&#8217; schools were more likely to enjoy school, with older children starting to talk about going to university and getting a job, while children from &#8216;disadvantaged&#8217; schools found school boring, complained about teachers shouting at them and treating them unfairly, and talked about going to school in order to avoid problems in future. Children in the &#8216;advantaged&#8217; schools were more likely to take part in after school activities and school trips, while parents of the children in the &#8216;disadvantaged&#8217; schools found the costs and necessary travel prohibitive. However, evidence of effectiveness of interventions to raise aspirations and increase access to after school activities is limited.</p>\n<p>A report by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission (2004) finds that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While differences in school quality can only explain around a fifth of variation in children&#8217;s attainment, with the rest more likely to be related to home environment, family background and parenting, there are regional differences in attainment by disadvantaged children that suggests schools may be able to influence performance.</li>\n<li>Performance peaks around the C/D borderline for GCSE, reflecting that many schools focus on raising attainment to improve performance against key indicators, at the expense of lower attainers.</li>\n<li>Some teachers&#8217; expectations are too low and the best teachers are not incentivised to work in schools that perform worse than others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Reading has a diverse school age population with a much higher than average proportion of children from black and minority ethnicities and whose first language is not English. Most primary age children attend a school within Reading Borough that is rated &#8216;outstanding&#8217; or &#8216;good&#8217; by Ofsted. Secondary school aged children are less likely to attend an &#8216;outstanding&#8217; or &#8216;good&#8217; school and more likely to attend a school outside of Reading Borough. Although performance against key performance indicators on attainment at Key Stage 4 show that overall attainment in Reading is better than the England average, this does not reflect the wide disparity in attainment levels for children at this stage of their education in Reading. In particular, children from more deprived families appear to be much less likely to achieve in line with their peers.</p>\n<p>National and local policies focus on setting higher expectations for all pupils, improving school and teaching quality.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/early-years-foundation-stage-attainment/\">Early Years Foundation Stage Attainment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/children-and-young-people/\">Children &amp; Young People</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Department for Education.

Social and economic circumstances play a critical role in shaping the life chances of children. Every child and young person in Reading should be allowed to grow up safe from abuse, exploitation, neglect and crime.</p>\n<h2>Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH)</h2>\n<p>Implementation of the Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) &#8211; This is the first point of contact for safeguarding concerns and significantly improves the sharing of information between agencies to help protect children from harm, neglect and abuse. MASH is a quicker and more informed decision-making/ action process.</p>\n<h2>Reading&#8217;s Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB)2</h2>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Local Safeguarding Children Board makes sure that key agencies work together to keep local children and young people safe. The Board&#8217;s role is to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, and ensure the effectiveness of what is done by each agency that works with children.</p>\n<p>Section 13 of the Children Act 2004 requires each local authority to establish a LSCB for their area and specified the organisations and individuals (other than the local authority) that should be represented on LSCB&#8217;s2.</p>\n<p>Reading LSCB review performance data and audit evidence to decide and agree priorities locally. In October 2014, the agreed current priorities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domestic Abuse</li>\n<li>Strengthening the Child&#8217;s Journey and Voice</li>\n<li>Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) and other particularly vulnerable groups</li>\n<li>Neglect</li>\n<li>Effectiveness and impact of Reading LSCB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further details regarding LSCB function and protocols can be found on the LSCB website: <a href=\"http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/\">www.readinglscb.org.uk</a>.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Reading has 35,900 children aged 0-17 (at mid-year 2014 (Projection) based on 2011 census).</p>\n<p>2014/15 data tells us that 4929 contacts are made to MASH. 1673 of these contacts lead to referrals &#8211; this is 34%.</p>\n<p>The top 3 reasons for referral are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domestic Violence &#8211; 13.3%</li>\n<li>Physical abuse &#8211; 7.4%</li>\n<li>Sexual abuse &#8211; 6.8%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following referral, there were1197 completed assessments. 301 initial Child protection conferences (2014/15) &#8211; increase from 229 (2013/14). 121 children referred to Early Help (2014/15).</p>\n<p>Assessment factors (2014/15) &#8211; the top 3 factors in assessment outcomes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domestic violence &#8211; 46%</li>\n<li>Neglect &#8211; 17%</li>\n<li>Emotional abuse &#8211; 15%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parental factors such as domestic abuse, substance misuse, parental learning difficulties, and mental health issues can impact on the safety and health of children.</p>\n<p>Children who have been abused or neglected may experience physical or emotional harm. The effects can be short term but sometimes they last into adulthood. Long term effects of abuse and neglect include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>emotional difficulties such as anger, anxiety, sadness or low self-esteem</li>\n<li>mental health problems such as depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), self-harm, suicidal thoughts</li>\n<li>problems with drugs or alcohol</li>\n<li>disturbing thoughts, emotions and memories that cause distress or confusion</li>\n<li>poor physical health such as obesity, aches and pains</li>\n<li>struggling with parenting or relationships</li>\n<li>worrying that their abuser is still a threat to themselves or others</li>\n<li>learning difficulties, lower educational attainment, difficulties in communicating</li>\n<li>behavioural problems including anti-social behaviour, criminal behaviour.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE)</h2>\n<p>Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) is a form of sexual abuse that requires effective multi-agency partnership working to safeguard those who are being abused and those at risk of being exploited. CSE cannot be dealt with solely by individual local authorities, police divisions or public health authorities each operating in their own silos. Offenders and victims cross administrative boundaries and so should the collective response of the LSCB to safeguard the children of Reading.</p>\n<p>Reading LSCB has written &#8216;A Strategy to Safeguard Children and Young People at Risk of or Experiencing Sexual Exploitation in Reading 2014 &#8211; 2017&#8217;5. This 3-year strategy builds on the progress that has already been made in Reading to ensure that we are effective in Preventing CSE from happening, Protecting those who may be at risk, to Pursue and Disrupt those who may be posing a risk to children and to ensure victims of CSE are supported in their Recovery.</p>\n<p>Whilst we recognise there is still more to do to ensure we are effective in tackling all aspects of CSE across the Reading LSCB partnership, progress has been made in a number of areas that gives a strong foundation for moving forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LSCB now has a CSE and Missing steering group reporting to the LSCB, chaired by the Director of Children and Education Services.</li>\n<li>The CSE and Missing Children Operational Mapping Group is fully established.</li>\n<li>CSE champions have been identified across Reading Borough Council.</li>\n<li>There has been significant investment in training of professionals through single and multi-agency training at universal, targeted and specialist levels.</li>\n<li>Bespoke training has been delivered on sharing intelligence with the police and guidance issued to frontline practitioners.</li>\n<li>An educational/preventative programme has been delivered in nine schools which included the use of &#8216;Chelsea&#8217;s choice&#8217; reaching approximately 2000 young people.</li>\n<li>Completed and ongoing investigations pursuing those who have harmed or present a CSE risk to children.</li>\n<li>We have a number of established services to support victims of CSE including: counselling services, CSE champions, Source Team, Health drop ins, Youth Outreach nurse and Targeted Youth Support.5</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<h3>Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) Data</h3>\n<p>All MASH contacts are reviewed, screened and triaged and if it meets threshold, cases are immediately sent to Access and Assessment (A&amp;A) for a S47 risk assessment, S17 Child and Family Assessment or for short term duty work.</p>\n<p>Cases that clearly meets threshold for Children&#8217;s Social Care involvement are sent to A&amp;A immediately without any further MASH action in order to prevent delay in assessment and intervention. In these circumstances, MASH involvement stops at the point of contact and the allocated/duty worker is responsible for further information gathering, assessment and action.</p>\n<p>Contacts that do not meet threshold for a referral to A&amp;A, is sent for Early Help Intervention. This is delivered by the Children&#8217;s Action Teams (CAT) or community resources and the MASH Early Help Co-ordinator facilitates the processing of these referrals for early intervention.</p>\n<p>Contacts that do not have appropriate consent, insufficient details or that are best dealt with by other resources are referred back to the contact-source with appropriate signposting and guidance, as/when appropriate.</p>\n<p>Cases that have been closed by Children&#8217;s Social Care within the past three months are referred back directly to the relevant team who is responsible for all decision-making and action with no role for MASH.</p>\n<p>When it is not possible to make an informed decision about which of the above actions to take due to lack of information or clarity, a case is put through the Confidential MASH Process. This means that proportionate and relevant information about the concerns are shared with our partner agencies in accordance with an information sharing agreement and the information is held within the secure hub of intelligence in MASH. The Police and Health are co-located with MASH and we contact satellite partner agencies by email and telephone.</p>\n<p>The cases in Confidential MASH process are RAG-rated (Red, Amber, Green) according to priority and urgency. This means that Red cases must be processed in 4 hours, Amber cases in 8 hours and Green cases in 72 hours. Partner Agencies then have the responsibility to consult their records and to make a professional judgement and share any proportionate and relevant information that would highlight/substantiate the safeguarding concern within the RAG rated timescales. This information is then processed and qualified social workers complete a risk assessment, analysis and then recommend one of the actions as listed above.</p>\n<p>Performance data for 2014/15 indicates 4929 children were referred to Reading&#8217;s Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH). This is a decrease compared to 2013/14 data which shows 5402 contacts. The total number of referrals for 2014/15 was 1673.</p>\n<p>The graph below shows the comparison of contacts to MASH team and those that are referred on for further assessment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5115/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 1: Total MASH contacts &amp; Total referrals 2014/15 &#8211; Purple Book 2014</p>\n<p>11% of the children referred to MASH in 2014/15 met threshold for further assessment.</p>\n<p>Table 1 below shows the number of contacts to MASH broken down by outcome &#8211; this is showing a comparison to last year data 2013/14. There is a huge decrease in contacts closed and logged as MASH and closed and logged as MASH after analysis &#8211; this means that assessing the needs of children is more thorough and that more cases are being referred to other services for interventions/ prevention services rather than being inappropriately assessed by children&#8217;s social care.</p>\n<p>The % of contacts sent to A and A team during 13/14 was 26% whereas the % of contacts sent on in 14/15 was only 10%. Therefore better screening and early analysis is having a significant impact on the number of families receiving social work involvement. However, there has also been a significant downturn in the number of contacts taken by mash in 14/15 which suggest a better understanding of thresholds for intervention across the partnership.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Number of contacts broken down by MASH outcomes\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Number of Contacts- Breakdown by MASH Outcomes</th>\n<th>2013-14</th>\n<th>2014-15</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Contacts Taken by MASH Team</td>\n<td>5402</td>\n<td>4929</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contacts Closed &amp; Logged as MASH-(No Form 5)</td>\n<td>2864</td>\n<td>1560</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contacts Closed &amp; Logged as Mash &#8211; After Analysis (Form 5)</td>\n<td>946</td>\n<td>251</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contacts sent from MASH Team to A&amp;A</td>\n<td>1436</td>\n<td>519</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Table 1: Number of contacts broken down by MASH outcomes 2013/14 and 2014/15</p>\n<p>Figure 2 below shows the comparison of the total MASH contacts and the contacts that were referred on to the A&amp;A team by month.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5126/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 2: No of contacts taken by MASH team and the number of contacts that were referred to the AA team 2014/15 &#8211; Purple Book 2014</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Number of MASH contacts per month 2014/15\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Number of MASH Contacts</th>\n<th>Apr-14</th>\n<th>May-14</th>\n<th>Jun-14</th>\n<th>Jul-14</th>\n<th>Aug-14</th>\n<th>Sep-14</th>\n<th>Oct-14</th>\n<th>Nov-14</th>\n<th>Dec-14</th>\n<th>Jan-15</th>\n<th>Feb-15</th>\n<th>Mar-15</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Contacts Taken by MASH Team</td>\n<td>404</td>\n<td>412</td>\n<td>387</td>\n<td>598</td>\n<td>314</td>\n<td>492</td>\n<td>410</td>\n<td>336</td>\n<td>454</td>\n<td>421</td>\n<td>342</td>\n<td>359</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contacts sent from MASH Team to A&amp;A</td>\n<td>49</td>\n<td>46</td>\n<td>43</td>\n<td>49</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>46</td>\n<td>54</td>\n<td>58</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>33</td>\n<td>47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>% of Contacts sent to AA Team</td>\n<td>12%</td>\n<td>11%</td>\n<td>11%</td>\n<td>8%</td>\n<td>9%</td>\n<td>6%</td>\n<td>11%</td>\n<td>16%</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n<td>9%</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Table 2: Number of MASH contacts per month 2014/15</p>\n<p>The table above shows the number of MASH contacts per month against the number of those contacts sent to Access and Assessment (A&amp;A team) for further assessment.

Again, this reflects LSCB&#8217;s number one priority to tackle domestic violence/ abuse.</p>\n<h3>Child Protection Plans</h3>\n<p>Figure 6 below shows the categories of abuse for those on child protection plans. The main category of abuse is neglect.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image6\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5132/image6/image/image6.png\" alt=\"image6 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 6: Child Protection Plans by Abuse Category Apr 14 &#8211; Mar 15 &#8211; Purple Book 2014</p>\n<p>The child protection plan numbers reflected in figure 6 record the category Neglect at 1192 compared to Emotional abuse 495, Physical abuse 252 and Sexual abuse 232. This means that 55% of children on child protection plans (2014/15) were subject to plans under the category of neglect.</p>\n<p>Neglect category remains high; this category is classified in a way which describes the impact on the child the most. The LCSB have produced a Neglect strategy to work towards reducing this category.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image7\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5133/image7/image/image7.png\" alt=\"image7 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 7 &#8211; Number of children who were subject to section 471 enquiries and initial child protection conferences, Year ending 31 March 2015 &#8211; CIN CENSUS</p>\n<p>There were a total of 579 children who were subject to Section 47 enquiries which started 2014/15.

A longer duration of 16-20 days and 21+ days is due to family and social worker availability for conferences.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image9\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5135/image9/image/image9.png\" alt=\"image9 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 9 &#8211; Number of children who became the subject of a child protection plan during the year ending 31 March 2015, by initial category of abuse &#8211; CIN CENSUS</p>\n<p>252 children became the subject of a child protection plan, of these 122 children were recorded as being neglected &#8211; this is 48% of cases. Of the 252 children who were subject to a child protection plan, 60 of these (23.8%) became the subject of a plan for a second or subsequent time (CIN CENSUS). This indicates that support may have been withdrawn too early. Some parents also disguise compliance and are not ready to have the support withdrawn.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image10\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5116/image10/image/image10.png\" alt=\"image10 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 10 &#8211; Number of children who were the subject of a child protection plan at 31 March 2015, by length of time as the subject of a plan &#8211; CIN CENSUS</p>\n<p>The majority of children/young people who are deplaned at the 3 month point have become Looked After; therefore it is appropriate that they are no longer subject of a Child Protection Plan.</p>\n<p>98.5% of cases who were the subject of a plan at 31 March 2015 and who had been the subject of a plan for 3 or more months were reviewed within the required timescales.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image11\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5117/image11/image/image11.png\" alt=\"image11 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 11 &#8211; Number of children who ceased to be the subject of a child protection plan1 during the year ending 31 March 2015, by length of time as the subject of a plan &#8211; CIN CENSUS</p>\n<p>202 Children ceased to be the subject of a child protection plan during the year ending 31 March 2015, of these 81 children were more than 6 months but less than a year.</p>\n<h3>Children in Need</h3>\n<p>A child in need is defined under the Children Act 1989 as a child who is unlikely to achieve or maintain a reasonable level of health or development, or whose health and development is likely to be significantly or further impaired, without the provision of services; or a child who is disabled.1</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image12\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5118/image12/image/image12_1.png\" alt=\"image12 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 12 &#8211; Numbers of Children in Need &#8211; 2014/15 &#8211; CIN CENSUS</p>\n<p>This data tells us that we are good at getting interventions to children and families to prevent them from going into mainstream child protection services.

This means that Social Workers are assessing children within a short timeframe and ensuring adequate and appropriate resources are in place for the child. 10% of long term open cases are still children in need after 2 years as they are mostly CIN disabled and they need support for their life time. On average 23% of referrals we receive either monthly or yearly are repeat referrals.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image17\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5123/image17/image/image17.png\" alt=\"image17 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 17 &#8211; No. of Children ceasing to be in Need at 31.03.15 by reason for case closure &#8211; CIN CENSUS.

Previously, local authorities carried out an initial assessment within 10 working days and (where needed) a more in-depth core assessment within 35 working days. Local authorities now have the flexibility to carry out a single continuous assessment within 45 working days. No distinction between the types of assessment carried out was recorded in the data collected in 2014-15.In Reading; the majority of cases are assessed within 11-20 days (21%) and 1-10 days (20%). Still there are 17% of cases which are 45+ days to complete. This is due to staff&#8217;s high caseloads and a high level of sickness.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image19\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5125/image19/image/image19.png\" alt=\"image19 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 19 &#8211; Factors identified at the end of assessment for episodes in the year ending 31 March 2015 &#8211; CIN CENSUS</p>\n<p>Figure 19 above shows the factors identified at the end of an assessment. There could be more than one factor recorded for an assessment. 46% of recorded factors relate to domestic violence and 42% of recorded factors are for &#8216;other factors&#8217;, again this category is indicating poor recording.</p>\n<h3>Looked After Children (LAC)</h3>\n<p>Below shows the number of new LAC entrants per month from April 2014 &#8211; Mar 2015. There was a total of 94 new LAC entrants for this period and a further breakdown of numbers are as follows for each age bracket:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under 1 &#8211; 23</li>\n<li>Aged 1-4 &#8211; 19</li>\n<li>Aged 5-9 &#8211; 20</li>\n<li>Aged 10-15 &#8211; 16</li>\n<li>Aged 16+ &#8211; 16</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a slight downward trend for each age category. Under 1&#8217;s are higher as this age range is removed from the home whilst the social worker is carrying out the assessment as they are too vulnerable. It is positive to see that early identification and analysis of risk has led to protective measures being taken for the most vulnerable group; that of babies.</p>\n<p>Greater awareness of &#8216;The Southwark Judgement&#8217; is likely to underpin the comparatively large number of 16+ young people entering care.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image20\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5127/image20/image/image20.png\" alt=\"image20 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 20: Number of children looked after by behaviour need &#8211; Jul 2014 &#8211; Mar 2015 &#8211; Purple Book 2014</p>\n<p>Figure 20 shows a high number of looked after children with BESD (Behaviour, Emotional and Social Difficulties) compared to the other behavioural need definitions. There is consequently a range of complex and chronic difficulties experienced by many children and young people with BESD and as such require support not just for the child but for the family also.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image21\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5128/image21/image/image21.png\" alt=\"image21 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 21: LAC ethnicity Apr 14 &#8211; Mar 15 &#8211; Purple Book 2014</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Ethnicity data for England and Reading 2014/15\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"3\">Comparative Data</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2014</td>\n<td>% White British</td>\n<td>% BME</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>England</td>\n<td>78</td>\n<td>22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>27</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>* some unknown/ restricted data</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Table 3: Ethnicity data for England and Reading 2014/15 &#8211; Purple Book 2014</p>\n<p>The majority of LAC are white British. Reading serves a diverse community so demographically these figures could be under representative. This data is not reflective of whether we are meeting the BME group needs when it comes to safeguarding children. BME communities don&#8217;t always present to children&#8217;s services so we must question this data and ask ourselves whether we are able to challenge behaviours when there is a cultural difference.</p>\n<h3>National &amp; Local Strategies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Working Together to Safeguard Children 2015</li>\n<li>The Childrens Act 1989</li>\n<li>Reading Local Safeguarding Children Board</li>\n<li>Domestic Abuse Strategy for Reading 2015-2018</li>\n<li>Strategy to Safeguard Children and Young People at Risk of or Experiencing Sexual Exploitation in Reading 2014 &#8211; 2017</li>\n<li>Reading Early Help Strategy 2013-2016</li>\n<li>Reading LSCB Neglect Protocol 2015</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<h3>Early Help</h3>\n<p>The Early Help service is working to identify needs and provide support to children, young people and their families at the earliest possible stage, improving outcomes and reducing costs. Supporting families who are experiencing domestic abuse with an objective of reducing repeat incidents is a key part of this strategy.4</p>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Early Help is a developing service with a positive trajectory in relation to increased referrals from a range of services and a reduced level of repeat referrals.</p>\n<p>There are regular &#8216;Team around the child&#8217; meetings that take place and performance data indicates that the service is making a positive impact for children and families.</p>\n<p>Referrals for the Early Help service come through the MASH as well as through other professionals. This shows the positive impact of the work in Early Help to simplify processes for referral and will be further built on by the work currently ongoing in respect of the Early Help pathways.2</p>\n<h3>Child Protection</h3>\n<p>Data for 2014/15 shows 55% of children on child protection plans were subject to plans under the category of neglect (Priority identified by the LSCB). There are many forms and reasons for neglect and the children&#8217;s workforce must be able to recognise the early signs to ensure support services are provided as soon as possible and action is taken to safeguard children.</p>\n<p>LSCB are working to raise the profile of neglect as an issue and have drawn up a Neglect Protocol6 for all partners which highlight the effects of neglect, short and long term.</p>\n<h3>Looked After Children</h3>\n<p>The number of LAC children and young people can vary from month to month as children and young people move in and out of the system. Younger children are more likely to become LAC as they are very vulnerable and need to be removed while the assessment process is undertaken (they can be placed with other family members). This enables more time for the social worker to work and assess the family and their circumstance as a whole.</p>\n<p>In March 2015, only 27% of LAC were in Reading Borough Council placements, excluding Family and Friends. The use of Fostering Agencies over the same period was 37%.</p>\n<p>As at the 31st March 2015, comparing the rate of LAC per 10,000 of the population Reading was at the same rate as its statistical Neighbours and the England average &#8211; 60, however this is higher than the South East Benchmarking which sat at 48.2.</p>\n<h3>Child Sexual Exploitation</h3>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s strategic priorities facilitate a multi-agency approach that emphasises the need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognise the possible indicators of sexual exploitation;</li>\n<li>Safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people;</li>\n<li>Work together to provide children with strategies to exit sexual exploitation;</li>\n<li>Investigate and prosecute those who coerce, exploit and abuse children and young people in this way;</li>\n<li>Ensure that voice of children informs service delivery and plans to keep them safe from CSE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reading and partners must:</strong></p>\n<p>Prevent: Child Sexual Exploitation takes place within our community. We must raise awareness and understanding of Child Sexual Exploitation in order to prevent children from becoming victims.</p>\n<p>Protect: work together to identify children at risk of, or subject to sexual exploitation, so that we can safeguard and support them and prevent further harm. It is important that professionals, public, families and children understand the many forms of CSE so that they are better able to protect children and not miss signs.</p>\n<p>Pursue and Disrupt: work together to assist in bringing offenders to justice and disrupt behaviour, whilst ensuring that children and young people are not subject to further risk and harm</p>\n<p>Recovery: ensure that victims of CSE are provided with the necessary support to aid their recovery. This support needs to be delivered in such a way that we do the right thing, in the right way and at the right time to aid their recovery. Recovery should also include the provision of services to enable them to reach their potential and reduce the likelihood of needing support services in the future.5</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<h3>Early Help</h3>\n<p>A single pathway is in place to improve referral processing and this needs to be reviewed. This will means the right support is offered to children and families at the right time.</p>\n<h3>Looked after Children (LAC)</h3>\n<p>The Looked After Children Sufficiency Statement Strategy 2015-2017 demonstrates how RBC plans to take steps that secure, as far as reasonably practicable, sufficient accommodation within the local authority area which meets the needs of children that the local authority is looking after. The lack of local placements in the Reading Borough Council area is demonstrated by the fact 33% of Looked After Children are placed more than 20 miles away from their home address. Whilst this may be a positive reason (such as children in adoptive placements or in specialist residential settings) this overall percentage figure is too high and must be reduced. It is important that children and young people live locally so that they can remain in contact with their family and community and retain stability in education provision and receive local health services.2</p>\n<p>The unpredictability of future demand despite best efforts to base projections on past trends and wider demographics remains a challenge when recruiting sufficient placements for looked after children. As does, recruiting sufficient numbers of RBC carers to match the needs of the children requiring placements in a competitive local environment.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<h3>LSCB Priority 1 &#8211; Domestic Abuse</h3>\n<p>Reading has a high prevalence of Domestic Abuse and this is one of the two key areas resulting in children being subject to a Child Protection Plan. A revised strategy is required to effectively join up the approach to this issue across children and adult&#8217;s services, and across both the children&#8217;s and adults safeguarding board partners and the Community Safety Partnership.</p>\n<p>The new Domestic Abuse Strategy 2015-18 has been produced during 2014/15 with input from both LSCB partners. There are 2 priorities relating to children and young people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving information and education &#8211; learning what a healthy relationship looks like and how to keep safe.</li>\n<li>Providing the right response at the right time &#8211; the MASH takes a key role in this process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to deliver the best possible response to the challenge of domestic abuse in Reading, we recognise that we need to know as much as possible about what domestic abuse looks like in the context of our diverse local community.4</p>\n<h3>LSCB Priority 4 &#8211; Neglect</h3>\n<p>Neglect is identified as a key issue for Reading. There is a need to develop a clear strategy and multi-agency approach to its reduction. The LSCB and evidence shown recommends that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A regular review of the LSCB threshold document7 is undertaken to ensure the inclusion of new signs and symptoms of neglect from research or Serious Case Reviews</li>\n<li>That key agencies ensure that their safeguarding policy and protocol adequately addresses the risks related to neglect and the need for timely and proactive intervention</li>\n<li>That all agencies provide access to training for staff in their organisation to assist with the identification and response to neglect.</li>\n<li>That all agencies ensure that staff are briefed or trained on the importance of listening to the voice of the child and mindful of the risks of the child&#8217;s voice being overshadowed by adult opinion or circumstance.</li>\n<li>That all agencies ensure that there is a record of significant events over time in the form of a chronology or log on order to assist with the identification of neglect and its impact on the child.</li>\n<li>That all agencies ensure that staff understand how to escalate concerns and are confident in the escalation process</li>\n<li>That all agencies fully participate in multi &#8211; agency assessments including the CAF and single assessment6</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading Borough Council need to ensure that CAT and CSC staff, as well as other agencies working with children and families are upskilled to be &#8216;experts&#8217; in assessing the impact of neglect. Staff should be trained in the use of the&#8217; graded care profile&#8217; assessment tool. Children&#8217;s Services to consistently use chronologies in assessment, analysis and decision making6</p>\n<h3>Child Sexual Exploitation</h3>\n<p>Continue working towards developing a clearer picture of the extent to which CSE affects children locally. Implementation of the Strategy to Safeguard Children and Young People at Risk of or Experiencing Sexual Exploitation in Reading 2014 &#8211; 2017 will facilitate improved recording, monitoring and reviewing to provide a sense of prevalence in the Reading area. Nationally we know that the issue has not always been recognised and that the extent of the problem has been underestimated.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Working Together to safeguard children 2015 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children</a></p>\n<p>Reading Local Safeguarding Children Board Annual Report 2014-2015</p>\n<p>NSPCC &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/signs-symptoms-effects/\">https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/signs-symptoms-effects/</a></p>\n<p>Domestic Abuse Strategy for Reading 2015-2018 http://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4335/Domestic-Abuse-Strategy-Nov-2015/pdf/DA_Strategy_final.pdf</p>\n<p>A Strategy to Safeguard Children and Young People at Risk of or Experiencing Sexual Exploitation in Reading 2014 &#8211; 2017 http://beta.reading.gov.uk/media/2554/item10appx/pdf/item10appx.pdf</p>\n<p>Reading LSCB Neglect Protocol 2015 http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAzADQAOQAwAHwAfABGAGEAbABzAGUAfAB8ADMANgB8AA2</p>\n<p>Reading Threshold Guidance http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAzADQAOAA4AHwAfABGAGEAbABzAGUAfAB8ADMANgB8AA2</p>\n<p>There is a Reading version of the safeguarding awareness video.  The video can be viewed via the link on the home page of the LSCB website (<a href=\"http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/\">http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/</a>)</p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Safeguarding is everyone&#8217;s business. Safeguarding means looking out for and trying to protect others in our community who are: vulnerable, or may be at risk of harm. If someone is at risk, an alarm needs to be raised. Everyone can make a difference.</p>\n<p>Abuse can happen anywhere. It may happen at home, in a care home, hospital, day centre or in a public place. Anyone can be an abuser, but it is usually someone known to the person.1</p>\n<h2>Care Act 2014</h2>\n<p>With the introduction of the Care Act 2014, Safeguarding adults is now based on a legal framework. The safeguarding provisions of the Care Act include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A requirement for all areas to establish a Safeguarding Adults Board to bring together the local authority, NHS and police to coordinate activity to protect adults from abuse and neglect.</li>\n<li>A duty for local authorities to carry out enquiries (or cause others to do so) where it suspects an adult is at risk of abuse or neglect.</li>\n<li>A duty for Local Safeguarding Adults Boards to carry out safeguarding adults reviews into cases where someone who experienced abuse or neglect died or was seriously harmed, and there are concerns about how authorities acted, to ensure lessons are learned.</li>\n<li>A new ability for Safeguarding Adults Boards to require information sharing from other partners to support reviews of cases or other functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>West of Berkshire Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB Board)</h3>\n<p>The West of Berkshire Safeguarding Adults Board is made up of local organisations which work together to protect adults at risk of abuse or neglect and keeps them safe. It is made up of senior staff from local agencies such as social care, health services, police, probation, fire and rescue, drug and alcohol services.</p>\n<p>The SAB&#8217;s role involves a range of activities, from raising awareness of safeguarding adult issues; delivering and commissioning high quality services; training and developing staff to recognise and respond appropriately to potentially harmful situations; investigating allegations of abuse or neglect; undertaking safeguarding adult reviews and developing services to support victims and perpetrators of abuse and neglect.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The Care Act 2014 defines the main different forms of abuse and neglect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical abuse &#8211; including assault, hitting, slapping, pushing, misuse of medication, restraint or inappropriate physical sanctions.</li>\n<li>Domestic violence &#8211; including psychological, physical, sexual, financial, emotional abuse; so called &#8216;honour&#8217; based violence.</li>\n<li>Sexual abuse &#8211; including rape, indecent exposure, sexual harassment, inappropriate</li>\n<li>looking or touching, sexual teasing or innuendo, sexual photography, subjection to pornography or witnessing sexual acts, indecent exposure and sexual assault or sexual acts to which the adult has not consented or was pressured into consenting.</li>\n<li>Psychological abuse &#8211; including emotional abuse, threats of harm or abandonment, deprivation of contact, humiliation, blaming, controlling, intimidation, coercion, harassment, verbal abuse, cyber bullying, isolation or unreasonable and unjustified withdrawal of services or supportive networks.</li>\n<li>Financial or material abuse &#8211; including theft, fraud, internet scamming, coercion in relation to an adult&#8217;s financial affairs or arrangements, including in connection with wills, property, inheritance or financial transactions, or the misuse or misappropriation of property, possessions or benefits.</li>\n<li>Modern slavery181 &#8211; encompasses slavery, human trafficking, forced labour and domestic servitude.

This provided the framework for councils to work with partner agencies such as the police, NHS and regulators to tackle abuse and prevent its occurrence. While they were urged to keep records there was no detailed guidance on what should be recorded and as a consequence, any data available was not comparable across councils.</p>\n<p>Safeguarding Adult Returns (SAR) is a mandatory data collection which records information about individuals for whom safeguarding referrals were opened during the reporting period (also referred to as adults at risk) and case details (also referred to as allegations) for safeguarding referrals which concluded during the reporting period. The purpose of the collection is to provide information which can help stakeholders to understand where abuse may occur and improve services for individuals affected by abuse.</p>\n<p>1st April 2013 &#8211; 31st March 2014 is the first year the SAR has been collected. Alerts and action types are no longer collected and demographics are recorded based on counts of individuals rather than referrals.</p>\n<h3>Local Data</h3>\n<p>Local data has been sourced from the Reading Borough Council Safeguarding Adults Annual Summary 2014/15 which is based on the data used to collate the SAR for 2014/15 and the previous SAR/AVA Abuse of Vulnerable Adults. Reading have only been recording &#8220;alerts&#8221; since 2012/13, prior to this all safeguarding incidents were recorded as referrals. The breakdown of data into these two categories means we can identify the number of concerns raised around an individual against the number of referrals that require further action.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Alerts and referrals (April 1st - March 31st)\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>2009/10</th>\n<th>2010/11</th>\n<th>2011/12</th>\n<th>2012/13</th>\n<th>2013/14</th>\n<th>2014/15</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Alerts</td>\n<td>&#8211;</td>\n<td>&#8211;</td>\n<td>&#8211;</td>\n<td>87</td>\n<td>163</td>\n<td>175</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Referrals</td>\n<td>219</td>\n<td>523</td>\n<td>668</td>\n<td>538</td>\n<td>491</td>\n<td>527</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>219</td>\n<td>523</td>\n<td>668</td>\n<td>625</td>\n<td>654</td>\n<td>702</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Closed referrals</td>\n<td>225</td>\n<td>532</td>\n<td>662</td>\n<td>539</td>\n<td>451</td>\n<td>513</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Table 1: Alerts and referrals (April 1st &#8211; March 31st)</p>\n<p>The number of alerts has slightly increased on last year, but was almost double what was recorded in 2012/13.

DoLS are a set of legal requirements which ensure that individuals are only deprived of their liberty in a proportionate way; providing protection for individuals in their Best Interests. The safeguards relate to adults aged 18 and over, lacking decision specific capacity and whose liberty is restricted in a hospital or registered care home. A DoL is a function of the Mental Capacity Act.</p>\n<p>Each individual for whom an application is made for a DoL must have a best interest assessment which incorporates both medical (approved to assess under S.12 of the Mental Health Act) and social care (qualified Best Interests Assessor &#8211; BIA) components. In cases of unsupported individuals, where information cannot be collected from an independent source, an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate is involved. This information is considered by the BIA who then decides the duration of deprivation and conditions, which are then authorised by the Local Authority known as the Supervisory Body.</p>\n<p>There are 6 criteria which must be considered in relation to all DoLS applications before authorisation can be sought5:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Age (must be over 18 years)</li>\n<li>Mental Disorder</li>\n<li>Lack of capacity</li>\n<li>Eligibility (consideration of the Mental Health Act 1983, updated 2007)</li>\n<li>No refusals (advanced decisions and/or Power of Attorney)</li>\n<li>Best Interest and least restrictive option.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Cheshire West Ruling</h3>\n<p>The Supreme Court ruling of 19th March 2014 introduced the &#8216;acid test&#8217; for consideration of restrictions. In summary previously a restriction would need to be considered on its intensity and duration as to whether or not it was considered a deprivation, the issue of the subject&#8217;s objection was also key to this. Now it is based more on the level of intrusion into and/or control over a person&#8217;s life, rather than the impact of those factors.</p>\n<p>It was this judgment which changed the eligibility for DoLS and resulted in the steep increase in referrals.</p>\n<p>Therefore a person is deprived of their liberty if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are under &#8216;continuous supervision and control&#8217; of those providing the care or support.</li>\n<li>They are not &#8216;free to leave&#8217;; either day-to-day, without being accompanied (even temporarily) or that another person(s) has made the decision around where they will live.</li>\n<li>They lack the capacity to understand and consent to the previous two points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Significantly, the ruling has now clarified that the principles of Deprivation of Liberty (DoL) apply to people living in the community, but the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards only relate to people in Registered Care Homes and Hospitals.</p>\n<p>Any issues relating to people in the community who lack capacity must be referred to the Court of Protection (CoP), until and unless the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards legislation is changed to cover people in the community.</p>\n<p>The Law Commission is undertaking a review that may include incorporating community-based DoL into the Safeguards. The Law Commission&#8217;s Review is due to report back to central Government in the Spring of 2017.5</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the number of DoLS applications that were authorised in 2014/15 following the change in legislation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image17\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5167/image17/image/image17.png\" alt=\"image17 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 17: Number of DoLS standard authorisation applications 2014/15</p>\n<p>During 2013-14 in England, 13,000 DoLS applications were completed, this was a 10% increase compared to the previous reporting year (11,900 applications). The number of applications has increased every year since the introduction of DoLS in 2009.5</p>\n<p>In 2013-14, there were on average 31 DoLS applications completed for every 100,000 people in England. There are some variations in this rate at regional level which may suggest differences in demographics or regional interpretation of the legislation. London had the lowest (16) whilst East Midlands had the highest (52) rates of applications per 100,000 people. These rates had remained similar over the previous 3 years. The figure above, of 31 DoLS applications per 100,000 people in England refers to the total number of DoLS applications made in that period including all instances of multiple applications for the same person. There were applications made for 9,400 individuals in 2013/14. This total gives the proportion of 23 out of every 100,000 men and 22 out of every 100,000 women in England who were the subject of DoLS applications.5</p>\n<p>In Reading there were 8 DoLS applications in 2013/14 which equals 5 for every 100,000 population (among the very lowest rates per capita in the country). This contrasts with the figure of 419 which were received in 2014/15 or 279 per 100,000. This data demonstrates the very large increase of applications received in the year 2014/15 following the Cheshire West ruling.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image18\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5168/image18/image/image18.png\" alt=\"image18 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 18: Application authorisation granted/ not granted 2013/14 &#8211; 2014/15</p>\n<p>In Reading, of the 419 applications received in 2014/15, 212 were granted (nearly 51%).</p>\n<p>The two graphs below highlights that 78% of the DoLS cases at start are for those aged 65 and over and 64% are for females.

However, approximately 20% of current authorisations are for less than a year. It is usual for those 20% to be fairly short-term; approx. 2 months. This increases the number of re-assessments required throughout the year by around 139.</p>\n<p>Therefore the total possible number of assessments for people in a care home is 838 per year. 838 applications per year amounts to 16 applications per week (using 52 weeks per year).</p>\n<p>Although this number does not include applications from hospitals, this estimate is believed to reflect a much higher number than reality especially when comparing to figures now available for 2014/15 of 419. Since these figures were produced in March 2015 by the SAT Team Manager 183 people in care homes have been assessed reducing the number further. Unfortunately, we are working to a &#8220;best guess&#8221; until we can establish more facts around Reading&#8217;s circumstances.</p>\n<p>This report will therefore split the difference between 838 (estimate) and 419 (last year&#8217;s figures) by dividing 419 in two (209) and adding to 419 as a guide. This new figure equals 628. 628 referrals a year equates to 52 assessments per week.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Care Act 2014 &#8211; framework for protecting adults from abuse and neglect.</li>\n<li>The Mental Capacity Act 2005</li>\n<li>The Care Act 2014</li>\n<li>The Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice (DH 2007)</li>\n<li>The Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Code of Practice (DH 2008)</li>\n<li>Safeguarding Adults Policy and Procedures</li>\n<li>The Data Protection Act 1998</li>\n<li>The Equality Act 2010</li>\n<li>The Human Rights Act 1998</li>\n<li>The Mental Health Act 1983</li>\n<li>The Health and Social Care Act 2008</li>\n<li>Building Partnerships, Staying Safe, Department of Health 2011</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>The aim is to prevent escalation &#8211; this is the responsibility of us all &#8211; our duty of care.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Respiratory conditions are diseases that affect the air passages, including the nasal passages, the bronchi and the lungs. They range from acute infections, such as influenza, pneumonia and bronchitis, to chronic conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (WHO, 2015). Respiratory diseases are a major cause of morbidity and death in the UK and worldwide. This JSNA highlights the need for the prevention and early intervention strategies for respiratory diseases and will focus primarily on <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Asthma/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Asthma</a>.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not one single disease but an umbrella term used to describe chronic lung diseases that cause ongoing limitations in lung airflow. The more familiar terms &#8216;chronic bronchitis&#8217; and &#8217;emphysema&#8217; are no longer used, but are now included within the COPD diagnosis.</p>\n<p>The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness, or a &#8216;need for air&#8217;, excessive sputum production, and a chronic cough. However, COPD is not just simply a &#8220;smoker&#8217;s cough&#8221;, but an under-diagnosed, life threatening lung disease that may progressively lead to death.</p>\n<p>The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke (including second-hand or passive exposure). Other risk factors for COPD include occupational dusts and chemicals (such as vapours, irritants, and fumes) and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood.</p>\n<p>Asthma is a major non-communicable lung disease. When a person with asthma comes into contact with something that irritates their sensitive airways (an <a title=\"Asthma triggers\" href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/\">asthma trigger</a>), it causes their body to react in three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten so that the airways become narrower</li>\n<li>the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell</li>\n<li>sticky mucus or phlegm sometimes builds up, which can narrow the airways even more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These reactions cause the airways to become narrower and irritated &#8211; making it difficult to breathe and leading to <a title=\"Asthma symptoms\" href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/understanding-asthma/symptoms/\">asthma symptoms</a>, such as chest tightness, wheezing, or coughing.. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are firstly genetic &#8211; having a parent with asthma, or having a history of (such as eczema or hay fever) or allergies; and secondly environmental triggers such as smoking (active or passive) and environmental pollutants. Whilst nationally 3 people die every day from asthma, two thirds of cases are preventable and with good management of asthma people can enjoy a full and active normal life</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>COPD is the fifth biggest killer disease in the UK, killing approximately 25,000 people a year in England. Respiratory disease kills one in four people in the UK, and accounts for more deaths each year (153,000) than coronary artery disease (132,000) or non-respiratory cancer (119,000).</p>\n<p>Deaths from respiratory disease do not appear to be falling; indeed, the number of females</p>\n<p>dying from lung disease has increased by 28% in the last 14 years, while lung cancer has now overtaken breast cancer as the most common cause of cancer deaths in British women today.</p>\n<p>About 5.4 million People in the UK are currently receiving treatment for asthma: 1.1 million children (1 in 11) and 4.3 million adults (1 in 12). Although deaths from asthma have plateaued at between 1000 and 1200 deaths a year since 2000, it is estimated that 90% of deaths are associated with preventable factors. Almost 40% of these deaths are in the under 75-age group. Asthma is also responsible for large numbers of hospital admissions, the majority of which are emergency admissions.</p>\n<p>In 2011-13, there were 93 premature deaths in Reading from respiratory diseases. This is a rate of 35 per 100,000 people aged under-75, which is now similar to both the national and deprivation decile rate. Reading&#8217;s pattern of premature mortality rate for men and women mirrors the national picture, with more men dying from respiratory disease. Reading&#8217;s female mortality rate was below the national rate but has increased since 2008-10, while the male rate has declined (figures 1 and 2).</p>\n<p>In Reading 51% of premature deaths were from respiratory disease were considered preventable in 2011-13; this is similar to a national figure of 54% (figure 3).</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5032/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 1: Under 75 mortality rate from respiratory disease in Reading per 100,000 (male)</p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework (November 2014)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5033/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Under 75 mortality rate from respiratory disease in Reading per 100,000 (female)</p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework (November 2014)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5034/image3/image/image3_1.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 3: Under 75 mortality rate from respiratory disease considered preventable in Reading per 100, 000 (persons)</p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework (November 2014).</p>\n<p>In March 2014, the estimated recorded prevalence rates for specific respiratory diseases in Reading were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asthma &#8211; 5.5%; and</li>\n<li>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease &#8211; 1.0%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recorded prevalence of Asthma in Reading reduced slightly from 2013 to 2014, while that of COPD remained the same (figure 4).</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5035/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 4: Recorded prevalence of respiratory diseases in Reading (2013/14)</p>\n<p>Source: Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre; Quality and Outcomes Framework 2013/14</p>\n<p>The Quality Outcome Framework measures the recorded prevalence of different conditions and is based on the number of people on GP registers at the end of March.

Berkshire West</a> is the respiratory network formed to co-ordinate, integrate and plan services for people with respiratory conditions in the Berkshire west area. The network includes patients and people working in primary and secondary care, community care, medicines optimisation, public health and community pharmacies.</p>\n<p>The high-level indicator on mortality from respiratory disease in people under 75 is shared by both the NHS and the Public Health Outcomes Frameworks. As the Outcomes Strategy for COPD and Asthma set out, the areas for action in public health and prevention are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>developing prevention strategies for respiratory disease</li>\n<li>raising awareness of good lung health</li>\n<li>persuading the public to take lung health seriously</li>\n<li>ensuring employers (particularly those in &#8216;at risk&#8217; environment) are doing all they can to protect staff and encourage good lung health</li>\n<li>empowering partners/communities to support the process of encouraging prevention</li>\n<li>targeted campaigns to raise public awareness of respiratory diseases and early symptoms and to encourage early presentation</li>\n<li>People with COPD and some people with asthma are eligible for the seasonal flu vaccine, and should be made aware by their healthcare professionals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Current evidence suggests that physical activity participation should be recommended to patients with chronic respiratory conditions, following appropriate pre-screening</p>\n<p>As respiratory disease is often associated with other conditions, it is important that both the physical and mental health of people with COPD and asthma are assessed and addressed to ensure that people access care in a holistic way (DOH, 2011).</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Respiratory disease also places a high burden on the health service, being the most common reason for general practice consultation or emergency medical admission to hospital. A third of the population visits their GP at least once a year because of a respiratory condition.</p>\n<p>People with asthma are at high risk of severe disease and complications from flu (or influenza- a respiratory illness that is caused by a virus); though they are not more likely to contract the virus, it can be more serious for people with asthma, even if their asthma is mild or their symptoms are well-controlled by medication. Due to the fact that people with asthma have sensitive airways, influenza can cause further inflammation, triggering asthma attacks and a worsening of asthma symptoms. It also can lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. In fact, adults and children with asthma are more likely to develop pneumonia after being infected with the flu virus than people who do not have asthma. Asthma is the most common medical condition among children hospitalized with the flu and one of the more common medical conditions among hospitalized adults (CDC, 2015).</p>\n<p>Respiratory disease costs the NHS and society £6.6 billion annually, £3 billion in costs to the care system, £1.9 billion in mortality costs and £1.7 billion in illness costs with COPD, pneumonia and chest infections accounting for more than 2.8million hospital bed-days per year (SEPHO, 2011).</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Respiratory disease is often associated with other conditions; about 40% of people with COPD also have heart disease, and significant numbers have depression and/or anxiety disorders (DOH, 2011).</p>\n<p>As with many health conditions, there is a range of inequalities in the outcomes and experience of people with respiratory disease; both mortality and morbidity from respiratory disease in the UK are linked to socio-economic background. Incidence and mortality rates from respiratory disease are higher in disadvantaged groups and areas, leading to worse outcomes and lowering our overall performance (BTS, 2006).</p>\n<p>Social inequality accounts for a higher proportion of deaths in respiratory disease (44%) than in any other disease. Research estimates suggest that the Routine and Manual (R&amp;M) occupational group represents almost half of the people with diagnosed or undiagnosed COPD in England. Men from unskilled, manual occupations are fourteen times more likely to suffer COPD than their more affluent peers (BTS, 2006).</p>\n<p>Aspects of people&#8217;s identity and their experiences of inequality interact with each other. For example, people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups are more likely to live in deprived areas and have negative experiences, both because of their ethnic identity and because of their socio-economic status and living environment. The picture can be said to be worse for smokers from the most disadvantaged sectors of society, where research has shown in some cases (e.g. for people with schizophrenia), smoking prevalence can reach 74%. Around 17% of deaths from flu each year are in people with chronic respiratory disease (DOH, 2015).</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>All patients with chronic respiratory conditions should be identified and entered on a chronic disease register, to aid intervention strategies such as smoking cessation, influenza vaccinations, anti-pneumococcal vaccination, structured review of prescribing and assessment for entry into rehabilitation programmes.</p>\n<p>In the vast majority of cases, lifestyle choices, such as smoking, increases the risk of developing COPD. Respiratory disease could largely be prevented (in the case of COPD and lung cancer) or mitigated (in the case of asthma) by changes in lifestyle behaviours. Smoking cessation is the single most effective and cost-effective way to reduce the risk of developing COPD and stop its progression. Brief tobacco dependence treatment is effective and every tobacco user should be offered at least this treatment at every visit to a health care provider.</p>\n<p>Progression of many occupationally induced respiratory disorders can be reduced or controlled through a variety of strategies aimed at reducing the burden of inhaled particles and gases. Reduction of total personal exposure to tobacco smoke, occupational dusts and chemicals, and indoor and outdoor air pollutants are important goals to prevent the onset and progression of COPD.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/long-term-conditions-in-children-and-young-people/\">Long Term Conditions in Children &amp; Young People</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cancer/\">Cancer</a></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>British Thoracic Society 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition (BTS, 2006) Burden of lung disease; A statistics report from the British Thoracic Society.</p>\n<p>http://www.sepho.org.uk/Download/Public/13157/1/Burden_of_lung_disease2007.pdf</p>\n<p>Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (2015): Flu and People with Asthma http://www.cdc.gov/flu/asthma/</p>\n<p>Centres for Disease Control and Prevention: The health consequences of smoking: a report of the Surgeon General.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Population ageing is a &#8216;game changer&#8217; for health and social care services. While many people remain well, engaged and active well into later life, report high levels of happiness and continue to make a major contribution to local communities &#8211; as carers or volunteers, for instance &#8211; increasing age also brings an increasing chance of long-term medical conditions, frailty, dementia, disability, dependence or social isolation.</p>\n<p>We can do much to prevent these problems or to help people live well with them, to retain their independence and keep out of hospital. But, in the end, we must also be realistic in acknowledging that older people often do need residential, nursing social care or rehabilitation after a spell of illness; that they will sometimes move into nursing or residential homes; and that support, choice and control towards the end of life are as important to them as they are to younger people with terminal illness.</p>\n<p>When older people are not able to live at home safely, there are a range of housing options available to support their health and social care needs. Residential care and nursing homes offer accommodation needs and personal care and support for people who may not be able to live independently.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Nationally, spend on older people is 52% (HSCIC 2014/15) of Adult Social Care&#8217;s gross budget (£10 billion out of a total £19.2 billion spend). Within the budget for supporting older people, residential and home care are the areas with the highest level of spend. However, the greatest numbers of people are supported through domiciliary care.</p>\n<p>Older People&#8217;s Residential Care Homes provide accommodation and care on either a short or long term basis. Reading Borough Council has 36 registered care homes within the Borough;</p>\n<p>14 are registered to provide services for older people. There are 5 homes in Reading that care for people with Dementia (1 of which is owned by the council), providing 149 beds.</p>\n<p>Nursing homes provide the same assistance with personal care as residential care homes, but the staff are nurse trained and higher levels of support are given to service users, providing 24 hour care for more complex health needs and frail elderly who may not be able to care for themselves. As well as nursing care, many homes offer rehabilitation services, a range of therapies and specialist care; including for dementia and cancer. Reading has 5 nursing homes and the council has placements in 143 of the 383 available beds.</p>\n<p>In Reading people are supported to remain in their own homes as long as possible. The NHS Five Year Forward View published October 2014 sets out a new shared vision for the future of the NHS based around the new models of care. Under this new care model there will be a greater partnership with care home providers to develop new shared models of care and support, including medical reviews, medication reviews and rehabilitation services. This has been achieved through establishing Vanguard sites. This is one of the first steps in supporting the improvement and integration of services.</p>\n<p>The frail elderly make up 2% of our population but account for 28% of health and care spending in Berks West.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<h3>National</h3>\n<p>On 31st March 2014 there were 213,000 supported residents in England. This is a reduction of 2,000 people on 2013&#8217;s figures. The overall number of supported residents has fallen by 22% since 2004.</p>\n<p>78% of supported residents were aged 65 and over in 2014. Almost half (42%) of supported residents in registered accommodation were aged 85 and over, compared to 24% aged 75 to 84 and 11% aged 65 to 74. The age distribution of supported residents has remained relatively unchanged from 2008-09.</p>\n<p>For supported residents aged 65 and over, 65% were in independent residential care, 30% were in independent nursing care and 4% were in council staffed homes in 2014. The percentage of clients in council staffed homes fell by 5% points from 2009 to 2014.</p>\n<p>Permanent admissions to residential and nursing care homes are measured in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework. They are shown as the number of council- supported permanent admissions of adults to residential and nursing care, excluding transfers between residential and nursing care (aged 65 and over), as a rate per 100,000 of the population aged 65 and over.</p>\n<p>In 2013/14 there were 65,000 admissions into residential and nursing care in England, which was a decline of 4% on 2012/13 figures. 93% of these admissions were for people aged 65 and over, which equated to 651 admissions per 100,000 population aged 65 and over.</p>\n<p>(Source: Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre (2014); Community Care Statistics, Social Services Activity &#8211; England 2013/14)</p>\n<h3>Local</h3>\n<p>Around 800 people per 100,000 of the population living in the Borough were permanently admitted to a residential or nursing home in 2011/12, as shown in Figure 1. This is a higher rate than both the national and regional average. Data from 2014/15 is shown in figure 1 below. (Note &#8211; there are plans to reduce by 20% for the next two years to bring in line with statistical neighbours).</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Permanent admissions of older people to residential and nursing care homes per 100,000 population.

Within the Reading Borough there are 14 residential homes caring for older people and 5 nursing homes providing a total of 781 beds for people aged 65 and over. The average cost of a residential placement to the council is £682.59 per week and the average cost of a nursing placement is £707.04 per week (excluding Registered Nursing Care Contribution).</p>\n<p>There is currently sufficient capacity within the market to cater for the council&#8217;s needs through till 2030 especially taking into account reduction in care home placements the Council intends to make each year and the effect the additional extra care housing will have on the care home market once all of the schemes are completed.</p>\n<p>However, it is clear that the beds being offered in the borough, outside of the council&#8217;s block contracts are not being offered to us at cost effective rates. Therefore, it may be necessary in the future to develop new nursing provision, not to meet capacity needs, but to mitigate the risk of market failure in this sector and provide additional secured capacity at a very good below market rate.</p>\n<p>The Better Care Fund 2015/16 Care Home Programme has focused on delivering training and education and has seen a reduction of 72 (20%) in non-elective admissions compared to 2014/15.</p>\n<p>The 2016/17 programme will be revised as a single programme which takes into account the work undertaken to date and integrates various work streams across Health and Social Care into a coordinated approach. The 2016/17 project will be delivered through a revised project group that will oversee the delivery of the objectives though 4 work streams that will focus more on collaborative working directly with key stakeholders, in particular the Care Home staff and Local Authorities in the delivery of the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A proactive and reactive support to care homes through the Care Home support team and the Rapid Response and treatment team. A tailored programme of training for care home staff will be delivered proactively and will help them to support residents to remain within their home as long as possible. This will be achieved through targeted training for UTI, pneumonia, falls and dementia using various models of delivery including train the trainer.</li>\n<li>Continued support from the Rapid Response team and on-going evaluation of the impact of the service supporting the care of residents in the home avoiding the need for hospital admission.</li>\n<li>Protocols and standards that are supported by all providers and focus on the delivery of quality social and health care and reducing the impact of any necessary interventions outside the care home, particularly length of stay in secondary care. The development of protocols, standards and ESD that support the care of patients in the care home will be in collaboration with partners.</li>\n<li>A model of care through GP practices that provides and consistent and collaborative approach to care within care homes. Looking at new models of care that potentially reduces the number of practices involved in each care home. This work stream will also include the support to medicines management to ensure review of process to ensure increased efficiency and therefore realisation of the KPIs</li>\n<li>A supportive health and Social care process for the monitoring of Care Home performance through collaborative working with all providers delivering aligned processes across Berkshire west.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The combined work of these work streams will contribute to the predicted delivery of a 45% reduction of NEL admissions and a 50% reduction in the use of the South Central ambulance service. The percentage reduction was arrived at by comparing the outcomes of best practice examples of similar schemes undertaken by similar health economies that, like Berkshire West, are in the top quartile for NEL performance.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>The main legal duties of the Local Authority are legislated through the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted\">Care Act 2014</a>. Part 1 of the Act focuses on the Adult Social Care reform. Section 2 (1) places a duty on local authorities to provide or arrange services that reduce and help delay the development of the need for support from people with care needs and their informal carers. Residential and nursing care providers are required to comply with the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/contents\">Care Standards Act 2000</a>. This Act enforced all care homes to be registered and regulated; introducing minimum standards for care services that take place. There have been several updates in terms of supplementary policy for residential and nursing services, including the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/14/contents\">Health and Social Care Act 2008</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/file/4981\">Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009</a>. Nationally all residential and nursing homes have to comply with Essential Standards of Quality and Safety and 28 specific outcomes that people who use the services have the right to expect from the service provider.</p>\n<p>Reading is developing an older people&#8217;s commissioning strategy, which will focus on 4 core themes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure older people stay healthy and independent for longer.</li>\n<li>To ensure that all older people are safe and respected both in the community and when receiving support.</li>\n<li>To ensure that older people have choice and control over the services they receive and have access to the right information in order to make decisions.</li>\n<li>To ensure high quality services in health and social care through robust quality monitoring</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>In Reading there is a Quality and Performance Monitoring Team who support local service providers to meet and exceed the national standards for the benefit of all residents. All new service providers for council funded services go through a series of checks before a placement is confirmed. Advice and support is available for those who do not come through social care processes to have to have their needs met. Our Quality and Performance Monitoring Team&#8217;s work with the Reading care home providers has given us a better understanding of the services operating in our Borough. Through the sharing of best practice and lessons learnt they have been able to improve the quality of services provided to all residents and to enable care homes to exceed the national standards or to become compliant with the Care Quality Commission again as quickly as possible should they fall below minimum standards.</p>\n<p>Their work with providers has enabled the Council to address issues before they become complaints or safeguarding cases. Following the introduction of our Quality and performance monitoring team we have seen a reduction in complaints and our safeguarding and quality concerns are now resolved faster and investigated more thoroughly than they have been in previous years. The Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) funded Care Home Support Service (currently provided by Berkshire Healthcare Foundation Trust) aims to deliver improved outcomes for people with dementia living in residential and nursing homes.</p>\n<p>The multi-disciplinary provider team works closely with care home staff to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deliver improved quality of life for people with dementia living in residential and nursing homes.</li>\n<li>Improve the skills of the care home staff by building their confidence and professionalism.</li>\n<li>Improve communication with people with dementia, and involvement of Carers. This will include their involvement with anticipatory planning for end of life care.</li>\n<li>To ensure referral to an appropriate clinician / service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The service will provide individual assessments for older people in care homes to review their physical and mental needs and care plan, thus providing a pro-active rather than reactive service.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</h2>\n<p>Reading is a small urban Borough with only 5 nursing homes. A needs analysis conducted for the Reading area shows that there are a sufficient number of nursing dementia beds within the Borough to cater for expected population increases through to 2030. However, the provision is held by 2 homes in the Borough with more than 75% of the available beds being held in one home. Should this home close, or should placements need to be suspended for any reason, the Council and many of its partner organisations would find themselves severely short of nursing dementia beds. Future consideration may be given to the building of new facilities to provide alternative nursing dementia provision and to provide additional competition in to the current market (See Dementia module for further information).</p>\n<p>One nursing home within the Borough is in the process of transforming from an older persons nursing home to a home that deals with younger people (40-55 years old) with a physical disability. The loss of 18% of the available nursing beds for the over 65 has put pressure on the Council to continue to meet placement demand. Future consideration may be given to the building of new facilities to provide additional nursing provision and to provide additional competition in to the current market.</p>\n<p>Whilst the home mentioned above is transitioning to cater for people with a physical disability, they have a significant waiting list of private clients and the Council struggles to make age appropriate placements for people with a physical disability when this home is full.</p>\n<p>The Council commissions services for a wide variety of people with varying health and social care needs. Nationally, one area with increasing need is bariatric care for people who are obese. Being obese is now recognised as being one of the World&#8217;s most significant and increasing health problems (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\">World Health Organization</a>). Whilst Reading Borough does not get many people with bariatric needs requiring residential/nursing care at this point, the current market does not cope well with bariatric care. It is often the case that whilst a care home can meet the personal care needs they often lack the necessary equipment and in some cases the additional staff to cater for bariatric care adequately. This is currently seen as a specialism by care home providers, rather than a normal service to be provided for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>End of Life Care,</li>\n<li>Housing and Homelessness.</li>\n<li>Excess Winter Deaths.</li>\n<li>Carers.</li>\n<li>Mental Health.</li>\n<li>Dementia</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Way forward</h2>\n<p>For 2016/17-2020/21 an overarching programme will be developed with Reading in line with the outputs from the Frail Elderly Programme providing an opportunity for Health and Social Care to work together, to address a wider range of aims and objectives that addresses the responsibilities both have to residents within the Care homes setting and to enable those homes most in need of support to be supported.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>A person with sight loss has difficulty in seeing, which cannot be corrected using glasses or contact lenses. This is also referred to as sight or visual impairment. An Ophthalmologist (generally based in an Eye Clinic) can measure how good a person is at seeing into the distance and around them. These measurements can then be used to decide how severe the sight loss is and whether or not the person is eligible to be registered as sight impaired/partially sighted or severely sight impaired/blind. If registration is appropriate, a Certificate of Visual Impairment (CVI) is completed. Only the Ophthalmologist can confirm eligibility for registration, by signing the document. The CVI is then sent to the relevant authority whose duty it is to then offer registration to the individual concerned; it is the authority that holds the register, not the hospital, and people can refuse to be registered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rnib.org.uk/knowledge-and-research-hub/key-information-and-statistics\">The Royal National Institute of Blind People</a> (RNIB) estimates that there are two million people with sight loss in the UK. This includes 360,000 people who are registered blind or partially sighted. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of people with sight loss in the UK will double to four million.</p>\n<p>Over 50% of sight loss is preventable, and many people are living with sight loss that can be improved. People should, therefore, be encouraged to attend screening with an optician so that any potential sight loss can be identified and addressed.</p>\n<p>The three major causes of preventable sight loss are age related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age related macular degeneration (AMD): there are two types of AMD, wet and dry. Dry AMD is the more common condition, which develops slowly has less severe outcomes. Wet AMD is the more serious condition, which causes severe sight loss in 10% of cases.</li>\n<li>Glaucoma: the eyeball contains a fluid which is constantly produced by the eye, with any excess drained though tubes. Glaucoma develops when the fluid cannot drain properly and pressure builds up within the eye, known as the intraocular pressure. Glaucoma often affects both eyes, usually to varying degrees; one eye may develop glaucoma quicker than the other.</li>\n<li>Diabetic retinopathy: Diabetic Retinopathy is when high blood sugar levels cause damage to the retina (light sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye), and is a complication of Diabetes. If left untreated, Diabetic Retinopathy can lead to blindness. Treatments such as pan-retinol laser therapy exist, and can prevent sight loss. All people with Diabetes are entitled to annual diabetic retinopathy screening.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prevention and treatment of these three conditions is the key objective in public health eye care. The numbers of people who are partially sighted or blind as a result of one of these three conditions are measured in the <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a>.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Key facts about sight loss:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are almost two million people in the UK living with sight loss. This figure includes those that have uncorrected refractive error or cataract that may be reversed. This figure also includes around 360,000 people registered as blind or partially sighted in the UK, who have severe and irreversible sight loss.</li>\n<li>Sight loss affects people of all ages but especially older people: 1 in 5 people aged 75 and 1 in 2 aged 90 and over are living with sight loss.</li>\n<li>There are over 25,000 blind and partially sighted children in the UK aged 0-16. As many as half of these children may have other disabilities.</li>\n<li>There is a link between sight loss and reduced wellbeing. Over one-third of older people with sight loss are also living with depression.</li>\n<li>Two-thirds of registered blind and partially sighted people of working age are not in paid employment.</li>\n<li>The number of people in the UK with sight loss is set to increase in line with population ageing: by 2050 the number of people with sight loss in the UK could be nearly four million.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sight loss can affect people of all ages but becomes more common with age. Older people with sight loss are also much more likely to have additional health conditions or disabilities. Sight loss impacts on a person&#8217;s life in many ways. It affects the way in which people perform tasks of daily living such as reading, cooking, cleaning, shopping and accessing facilities in the community. It also impacts on their employment and/or education, their social life, and their general wellbeing and mental health. People with a learning disability and people from black and minority ethnic groups are at a greater risk of sight loss (Action for Blind People).</p>\n<p>Excessive alcohol consumption and smoking have been found to significantly increase chances of developing AMD which is a major cause of sight loss.</p>\n<p>The provision of emotional and practical support at the right time can help people who are experiencing sight loss to retain their independence and access the support they need. A persons experience in the eye clinic is crucial. It is here that they receive their diagnosis, undergo treatment and potentially go through the process of receiving a Certificate of Vision Impairment &#8211; the latter can have a devastating effect on a person&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>Those affected by sight loss need to be well informed about their condition and how it will affect them now and in the future. They need to be empowered and made aware of practical support available, such as visual aids, educational and psychological support. They will also need access to a Rehabilitation Service to learn new daily living skills and for mobility training. Being put into contact with support networks and charities (<a href=\"http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/severe-and-partial-sight-impairment\">Blindness and Partial Sight</a>) can also be very helpful.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>There are an estimated 3,530 people living with sight loss in Reading. 420 people are living with severe sight loss (blindness).

    "title": "Population change",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Census data from 2001 and 2011 indicate there has been an increase of 11,300 people in the population of Reading Borough. During that time period annual estimates have indicated continued population growth. Statistical information suggests that the main drivers for population growth are international migration and &#8216;natural change&#8217; (the number of births minus the number of deaths in an area). The high number of births and patterns of international immigration have implications for the health needs of the population.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Office for National Statistics (ONS) annual mid-year estimates of population change consider a number of common contributing factors known as the &#8216;components of change&#8217;. The sum of these components provides an overall number.</p>\n<p>The components, which can be positive or negative, are broadly described as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8216;natural change&#8217; (the number of births minus the number of deaths in an area);</li>\n<li>Net migration (the number of people moving into the area minus the number of people moving out &#8211; for more information about migration patterns in Reading, see Migration section below); and</li>\n<li>other changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the population increase in the UK in the year to June 2014 was driven by both international migration (accounting for 53% of the increase) and natural change (46%). Local authority level data for Reading suggest similar trends locally, with population increase split almost equally between international migration (49.5%) and natural change (50.5%).</p>\n<p>Net international migration into Reading in the year 2013 to mid-2014 was 1583 (1583 more people moved to Reading from outside of the UK, than moved out of Reading to areas outside of the UK). These additional people accounted for 0.98% of the total population in mid-2014. This compares to 0.38% in the South East and 0.4% in the UK.</p>\n<p>By contrast, net internal migration for the South East indicates that almost 20,000 additional people were living in areas of the South East in 2014 after moving from other areas of the UK. This accounts for almost a quarter of the annual increase in total population. In the same period Reading saw a net <em>decrease</em> in internal migration of 1,493 people, indicating that more people left Reading for other parts of the UK that came to Reading.</p>\n<p>This is similar to trends seen in London, which saw a net decrease of 55,000 people to June 2013. Like London, Reading saw a high inflow into the area but an even higher outflow (Table 1).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Internal Migration Inflows and Outflows in Reading and South-East</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Internal Migration Inflows and Outflows in Reading and South-East\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Area</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">In-flow</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Out-flow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number</td>\n<td>% of mid-2013 pop</td>\n<td>Number</td>\n<td>% of mid-2013 pop</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading</td>\n<td>11,847</td>\n<td>7.44%</td>\n<td>13,340</td>\n<td>8.38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>South East</td>\n<td>242,323</td>\n<td>2.76%</td>\n<td>222,328</td>\n<td>2.53%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: ONS (MYE for Population Change for local authorities)</p>\n<p>ONS analysis into London moves suggests that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Young people move out of London for education</li>\n<li>Graduates move into London for work</li>\n<li>From their 30&#8217;s onwards, more people leave London (for more affordable housing, or for social or environmental reasons, such as social and educational environment for children).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As Reading has a strong economy and low unemployment, as well as a large university, it is possible to infer that Reading may be experiencing similar trends, with young people moving into Reading for work or graduates remaining in the town after their studies are complete (ONS, 2014). In contrast to the trends seen in London, however, Reading has seen an increase in the number of children in the population, suggesting that those moving to improve their children&#8217;s social and environmental conditions may remain within the Borough.</p>\n<p>The number of live births registered in Reading in 2013/14 (2627) was more than double the number of deaths registered in Reading in the same period (1013), giving a total of 1614 for &#8216;natural change&#8217;. The additional number of people in the population as a result of natural change accounts for 1% of the total population in 2014, compared to 0.49% in the South East and 0.35% in the UK. (ONS, 2015a)</p>\n<p>Taken together, these figures suggest that, to date, population increases in Reading have been more closely linked to a high rate of births and international migration than elsewhere in the South East and UK, and that Reading has seen a low net internal migration compared to the rest of the South East.</p>\n<p>Those migrating to the UK are likely to be in the 25-44 age group (ONS, 2015b; Cooper, Campbell, Patel and Simmonds, 2014). These trends are consistent with the changes in the age of population that have been observed in census data shown in Table 2 below. Data indicates that the largest increase by age group has been amongst the 30-59 age group, accounting for an additional 6,200 people, or more than half of the total population increase.

    "title": "Physical activity",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Physical inactivity carries risks of chronic illness and disability and is linked with poor mental health. It disproportionately affects those from lower socio-economic groups as well as women and those in older age groups and therefore contributes to health inequalities. Some 58,100 people in Reading do not reach the recommended weekly level of physical activity, of whom 34,000 (59%) are women and more than 8,000 (14%) are likely to be aged 65 or older.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Physical inactivity is the 4th leading risk factor for global mortality accounting for 6% of deaths globally. People who do have a physically active lifestyle have a 20-35% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those who have a sedentary lifestyle (WHO, 2011). As well as reducing the number of cases of chronic conditions, regular physical activity reduces the number of years spent living with a disability or chronic health condition (HSCIC, 2016; Murray et al, 2013).</p>\n<p>Regular physical activity is also associated with a greater sense of wellbeing and lower rates of depression and anxiety and there is some evidence that it can have a protective effect against cognitive decline in later life (Aked et al, 2008).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>The Active People&#8217;s Survey carries out telephone interviews with 165,000 people throughout the year (from October to September). Interviewees are randomly selected and calls are made at different times of the day to ensure a representative sample of the population is used. Interviews include questions about how often people take part in sport and active recreation and what kinds of activity they take part in. The data are used to help understand trends in participation in sport and physical activity and, importantly, are used to publish Public Health Outcome Framework measures showing the proportion of adults in each local authority area who are physically active and inactive.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: Percentage of Physically Active Adults in Reading 2012-2014</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><a title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5642/Figure-1/large/Figure_1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5642/Figure-1/image/Figure_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 Displays a larger version of this image in a new browser window\" /></a><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcome Framework indicator 2.13i</p>\n<h3>Figure 2: Percentage of Physically Inactive Adults in Reading 2012-2014</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><a title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5641/Figure-2/large/Figure_2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5641/Figure-2/image/Figure_2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2 Displays a larger version of this image in a new browser window\" /></a><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcome Framework indicator 2.13ii</p>\n<p>While the percentage of adults in Reading considered active (doing at least 150 minutes of moderate activity a week) (54.7%), is slightly lower than the England average of 57%, the percentage considered &#8216;inactive&#8217; (doing less than 30 minutes of moderate activity per week) (25.5%) is also lower than the national average of 27% (Figures 1 and 2).</p>\n<p>Further breakdown by the number of minutes spent doing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity  each week, indicates that higher percentages of Reading&#8217;s population than average were taking part in physical activity, but not reaching the recommended threshold of 150 minutes per week (nearly 20% were doing between 30 and 149 minutes of exercise per week, compared to averages of around 15% for both England and the South East). Of those who were meeting the threshold in Reading, a higher percentage were doing between 150 and 599 minutes of exercise per week than the average in England and the South East (63% of active people in Reading, compared to 55% in England and the South East), and a lower percentage were doing more than 600 minutes per week (37% of active people, compared to 45% in England and the South East).</p>\n<h3>Figure 3: Percentage of the population by minutes of physical activity per week</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><a title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5640/Figure-3/large/Figure_3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5640/Figure-3/image/Figure_3.png\" alt=\"Figure 3 Displays a larger version of this image in a new browser window\" /></a><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Active People Survey</p>\n<p>Expressing these as numbers of people rather than a percentage of the population helps to give a sense of the extent of the risks from physical inactivity in the local area. While the largest number of people in the population are meeting the threshold (more than 70,000), some 32,700 do no physical activity at all, while 25,400 people don&#8217;t reach the recommended level.</p>\n<h3>Figure 4: Number of adults in Reading by activity category</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><a title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5639/Figure-4/large/Figure_4.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5639/Figure-4/image/Figure_4.png\" alt=\"Figure 4 Displays a larger version of this image in a new browser window\" /></a><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Active People Survey</p>\n<p>Analysing these data by demographic factors suggests that women are more likely than men to be inactive or insufficiently active, accounting for 34,000 of those who do not do  enough physical activity (figure 5). The small number of people in each age group who took part in the survey from Reading makes it impossible to analyse local data by age group, however, trends in the data for all England suggest that levels of physical activity decrease with age (figure 6). Similarly, although the numbers in Reading are too small to analyse, National data suggest that those from lower socio-economic groups are less likely to be active than those from higher socio-economic groups.</p>\n<h3>Figure 5: Number of adults in Reading by activity category by gender</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><a title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5638/Figure-5/large/Figure_5.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5638/Figure-5/image/Figure_5.png\" alt=\"Figure 5 Displays a larger version of this image in a new browser window\" /></a><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Active People Survey</p>\n<h3>Figure 6: Percentage of adults in England by activity category by age group</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 6\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5637/Figure-6/image/Figure_6.png\" alt=\"Figure 6 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Active People Survey</p>\n<p>The Chief Medical Officer&#8217;s UK Physical Activity Guidelines recommend that all children aged 5-18 years participate in at least 60 minutes and up to several hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day (NHS Choices, 2016). In 2015 the Youth Sport Trust reported findings from the first National PE, School Sport and Physical Activity Survey. The survey was the first to collect data on PE and sports in schools since 2010, albeit with a different methodology, and has been designed to address a lack of up-to-date information and national intelligence on provision, children&#8217;s activity levels and emerging needs. Data are not available by Local Authority area, but National data has been used to identify some trends in physical activity in children and young people. Key findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>97% of primary schools and 85% of secondary schools said that they encourage physical activity as part of the school day.</li>\n<li>65% of schools said that they consult with pupils about the provision of sport in their schools.</li>\n<li>The average number of minutes spent taking part in PE in a typical week was 102 minutes for Key Stage 1 pupils and 114 minutes for Key Stage 2 pupils.</li>\n<li>On average, schools had links with 5 community or other sports clubs. Lower than the average 9 links reported in a similar 2009/10 survey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Public Health England&#8217;s 2014 report &#8216;Everybody Active, Every Day&#8217; estimated that lack of physical activity has led to an additional burden of £7.4 billion a year on health and social care services. Estimates based on the economic cost of risk factors for chronic disease suggests that there was a direct cost of £0.9 billion to the NHS in 2006-07, and an average of more than £6 million to each PCT area in 2009-10 (PHE, 2014, Scarborough et al, 2011, BHF, 2013).</p>\n<h2>National and Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>In 2011 the four Chief Medical Officers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland jointly published guidelines recommending levels of physical activity and highlighting risks of sedentary behaviour for all age groups. The report recommends the following for adults:</p>\n<p>Guidelines published by the Chief Medical Officer in 2011 recommend the following for adults:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity OR 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week (or a mixture);</li>\n<li>Strength exercises like lifting weights, push-ups or sit-ups, or yoga on at least two days a week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published advice to Local Authorities and local Health and Wellbeing Boards about encouraging people to be physically active. NICE advise consideration of: the implications for meeting public health responsibilities for reducing health inequalities; the burden of cost to social care services; the effects of lost productivity on sickness absence and the local economy; and the opportunity to encourage more physically active travel and reduce traffic flow and air quality. The recommendations include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure local commissioning strategies support physical activity, including those related to leisure, transport, housing, urban and rural development and local business.</li>\n<li>Encourage walking and cycling by ensuring there is a network of paths for walking and cycling locally, reducing road danger and the perception of danger, and ensuring other policies across organisations support walking and cycling.</li>\n<li>Ensure that leisure facilities are easy to reach and use, are safe and suit a range of ages, abilities and cultural norms.</li>\n<li>Provide green spaces and play areas that stimulate children and safely challenge them and consider playground design in schools.</li>\n<li>Introduce multi-component physical activity programmes involving schools, families and communities.</li>\n<li>Design new developments to encourage physical activity.</li>\n<li>Encourage stair use by providing clear signage and stairwells that are well lit and decorated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(NICE, 2013).</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Physical inactivity carries risks of chronic illness, disability and poor mental health and disproportionately affects those from lower socio-economic groups as well as women and those in older age groups. Some 58,100 people in Reading do not reach the recommended weekly level of physical activity, of whom 34,000 (59%) are women. Based on national trends, around 45% of those aged 65 and older are likely to do no physical activity. In 2011 there were 17,832 people aged over 65 in Reading, so we might estimate that there are more than 8,000 older people in Reading who do no physical activity at all.  Local Authorities can influence behaviour by ensuring that local commissioning and infrastructure supports and encourages physical activity, particularly in schools.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections for the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cardiovascular-disease/\">Cardiovascular Disease</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/diabetes/\">Diabetes</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental Health</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Aked, J, Marks, N, Cordon, C, and Thompson, S., 2008. <em>Five Ways to Wellbeing</em>.  New Economics Foundation (NEF). (Accessed 14th June 2016).</p>\n<p>British Heart Foundation National Centre, 2013. <em>Economic Costs of Physical Inactivity</em>. (Accessed 14th June 2016).</p>\n<p>Chief Medical Officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (2011). <em>Start Active, Stay Active: A report on physical activity by the four home counties&#8217; Chief Medical Officers.</em></p>\n<p>Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), 2016. <em>Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet</em>. <em>England 2016.</em> HSCIC.</p>\n<p>Murray et al, 2013.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Perinatal mental health refers to the mother&#8217;s mental health in the antenatal period up to the birth and for a year after the baby is born.</p>\n<p>Maternal mental health is critical in the antenatal period and for the first year of life for her baby, as it can affect attachment and communication between the mother and baby.</p>\n<p>There is a large body of evidence which show a small but significant association between perinatal mental illness and an increased risk of poor child psychological and developmental outcomes (<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61277-0/abstract\">Stein, et al., 2014</a>).</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>More than 1 in 10 women develop a mental illness during pregnancy or within the first year after having a baby. Examples of perinatal mental illness include: <strong>antenatal depression, postnatal depression, maternal obsessive compulsive disorder, postpartum psychosis and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong>. These illnesses can be mild, moderate or severe, requiring different kinds of care or treatment (<a href=\"http://everyonesbusiness.org.uk/?page_id=6\">Maternal Mental Health Alliance</a>, 2014). If untreated, perinatal mental illnesses can have a devastating impact on the women affected and their families.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg192\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guidance 192</a> (NICE, 2014) states that women should be assessed for levels of anxiety and depression in pregnancy and after birth. Midwives and health visitors are required as part of the maternal mental health pathway to ask two key questions about depression called the Whooley questions , for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?</li>\n<li>During the past month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, if concerned, the practitioner is required to ask a further two questions from the generalised anxiety and depression (GAD-2) scale.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the past month, have you been feeling nervous, anxious or on edge?</li>\n<li>During the past month have you not been able to stop or control worrying?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, if high scores remain high, a further set of questions are asked; either from the Edinburgh Depression score or from the GAD-7.</p>\n<p>Whatever the level of anxiety and depression the mother should be supported with evidence based prevention or treatment interventions as set out in the latest NICE guidance.</p>\n<p>Women with severe anxiety or depression in pregnancy should be referred to psychological therapies for cognitive behaviour therapy yet midwifery teams note anecdotally that about half of these do not attend as they need support to attend such services or different approaches that allow them to engage with the therapy services.</p>\n<p>As part of the Royal College of Nursing Pressure Points Campaign they have published a report on <a href=\"https://www.rcm.org.uk/sites/default/files/Pressure%20Points%20-%20Mental%20Health%20-%20Final_0.pdf\">maternal mental health</a> (RCM, 2014). 25% of mothers surveyed reported feeling significantly depressed or down after the birth of their baby with a further 35% reporting feeling a little bit depressed or down. 25% of student midwives felt that they had not enough theoretical knowledge about maternal mental health and 27% felt that they would no feel confident in recognising the signs of emotional health issues in women they care for. The vast majority of midwives felt that the focus of postnatal care should be on emotional support, compared to clinical observation and health promotion. 75% of mothers report been asked how they were coping during postnatal visits though some reported feeling that this was a &#8220;tick box exercise&#8221;. 35% of midwives would like to do more to support the emotional wellbeing of new mums.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/local-transformation-plans-cyp-mh-guidance.pdf\">Local CAMHS Transformation Planning Guidance</a> <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/local-transformation-plans-cyp-mh-guidance.pdf\">(NHS England, 2015)</a> based on the recent Future in Mind report clearly states that local plans should place high emphasis on improving perinatal mental health.</p>\n<p>For further information around perinatal mental health please see the dedicated area of the <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170302130008/http://www.chimat.org.uk/resource/item.aspx?RID=187499\">Child and Maternal Health Intelligence Network</a>.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>The &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.jcpmh.info/resource/guidance-perinatal-mental-health-services/\">Guidance for commissioners of perinatal mental health services</a>&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.jcpmh.info/resource/guidance-perinatal-mental-health-services/\">(JCPMH, 2012)</a> estimated the numbers of women affected by perinatal mental illnesses in England each year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Postpartum psychosis &#8211; 2 per 1,000 maternities &#8211; approximately 1,380 women</li>\n<li>Chronic serious mental illness &#8211; 2 per 1,000 maternities &#8211; approximately 1,380 women</li>\n<li>Severe depressive illness &#8211; 30 per 1,000 maternities &#8211; approximately 20,640 women</li>\n<li>Post traumatic stress disorder &#8211; 30 per 1,000 maternities &#8211; approximately 20,640 women</li>\n<li>Mild to moderate depressive illness and anxiety state &#8211; 100-150 per 1,000 maternities &#8211; approximately 86,020 women</li>\n<li>Adjustment disorders and distress &#8211; 150-300 per 1,000 maternities &#8211; approximately 154,830 women</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As yet, we do not have any local baseline data or trends in perinatal mental health problems assessed antenatally or postnatally, as this data is collected on individuals who are then referred by local midwifery and health visiting teams to &#8216;Introducing Access to Psychological Therapy&#8217; services (IAPT) commissioned by CCGs.</p>\n<p>From October 2015, anonymised postcode level data on risk will be collected by health visiting teams allowing better targeting of prevention and treatment services.

Key risk factors are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any past or present severe mental illness</li>\n<li>past or present treatment by a specialist mental health service, including inpatient care</li>\n<li>any severe perinatal mental illness in a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If high risk scores are identified, women should be referred to a secondary mental health service (preferably a specialist perinatal mental health service) for assessment and treatment. This will include women who have or are suspected to have severe mental illness, as well as those that have any history of severe mental illness, whether during pregnancy, in the postnatal period or at any other time. In both cases, the woman&#8217;s GP should know about the referral.</p>\n<p>Where a woman has any past or present severe mental illness, or there is a family</p>\n<p>history of severe perinatal mental illness in a first-degree relative, practitioners should be alert for possible symptoms of postpartum psychosis in the first two weeks after childbirth.</p>\n<p>If a woman has sudden onset of symptoms suggesting postpartum psychosis, she should be referred to a secondary mental health service (preferably a specialist perinatal mental health service) for immediate assessment (within four hours of referral).</p>\n<p>When a woman with a known or suspected mental health problem is referred in pregnancy or the postnatal period, she should be assessed for treatment within two weeks of referral and provided with psychological interventions within one month of initial assessment.</p>\n<h2>Current local activities and strategies include:</h2>\n<p>Public Health funding has been allocated to engage a local expert(s) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review existing workforce training.</li>\n<li>Create/ identify an evidence based training package and identify a mechanism for multiagency delivery.

Where women with a history of severe depression initially present with mild depression in pregnancy or the postnatal period, pharmacological therapies should be considered.</p>\n<p>For a woman with moderate or severe depression in pregnancy or the postnatal period, options should include a high-intensity psychological intervention, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT); or</li>\n<li>tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or Serotonin and norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (S)NRI; or</li>\n<li>high-intensity psychological intervention in combination with medication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inconclusive evidence from reviews of interventions other than pharmacological, psychosocial and psychological for treating antenatal/postnatal depression include:</p>\n<p>depression-specific acupuncture, maternal massage, bright light therapy or omega-3 fatty acids to treat antenatal depression.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The level of dental decay in five-year-old children is a useful indicator of the success of a range of programmes and services that aim to improve the general health and wellbeing of young children. In the Public Health Outcomes Framework, one of the indicators is the dental decay level in children aged five years <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/public-health-outcomes-framework\">(PHE, 2014)</a>.</p>\n<p>Since 1973, a survey has been carried out every ten years into the dental health of 5, 8, 12 and 15 year old children in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The most recent survey (2013) was published in March 2015 by the <a href=\"http://www.hscic.gov.uk/catalogue/PUB17137\">Health and Social Care Information Centre.</a></p>\n<p>The Public Health England Dental Public Health Intelligence Programme supports the collection of reliable information on oral health needs in local populations. They undertake a rolling programme of surveys into the dental health of specific age groups/populations. They are currently planning on conducting a survey of older people. Older people in Reading will be offered the opportunity to take part in the latest survey. Previous surveys have looked at children attending special schools (2013/14), three year olds (2013) five year olds (2011/12) and 12 year olds (2008/09). (Public Health England).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO, 2012) estimates that globally, 60-90% of children and nearly 100% of adults have suffered from dental decay. As part of a series on national epidemiological surveys, Public Health England has recently published the findings of the latest 5 year-old children dental survey. The surveys assess a sample of children by counting the number of teeth they have which are decayed, missing, or filled (DMF). The tables below summarises some key points from the survey:</p>\n<p>Tables 1 and 2: Results of dental survey of 5 year-olds 2012</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Results of dental survey of 5 year olds 2012\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Region</th>\n<th>Population (5 years)</th>\n<th>Drawn Sample</th>\n<th>Percentage Examined</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>England</th>\n<td>635,925</td>\n<td>204,640</td>\n<td>65.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<td>1,965</td>\n<td>466</td>\n<td>59.9%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Results of dental survey of 5 year olds 2012\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Region</th>\n<th>Percentage of children who had experienced tooth decay</th>\n<th>Average number of DMF teeth per child in the whole</p>\n<p>sample</th>\n<th>Average no. of DMF teeth per child in sample of patients with tooth decay</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>England</th>\n<td>27.9%</td>\n<td>0.94</td>\n<td>3.38</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<td>36.6%</td>\n<td>1.43</td>\n<td>3.90</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source:  Public Health England</p>\n<p>The results reinforce the early presentation of health inequalities. By 5 years of age, children are assessed as having more DMF teeth on average in Reading than in England as a whole. The data also highlights the variation in the distribution of DMF teeth. While the average number of affected teeth for Reading 5-year-olds is 1.43, for those with DMF teeth, the average number of teeth affected is almost 4. Data is available for other age groups and, whilst somewhat of historical importance, all reinforce the inequalities described previously.</p>\n<p>Table 3 below brings together survey findings for the other age groups (as well as 5 year olds) comparing Reading against England averages. The data clearly demonstrates that the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth is worse than the England average at all 3 age stages. It is particularly worse at 3 and 5 years of age.</p>\n<p>Table 3: Results of dental survey for 3, 5 and 12 year old children</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Results of dental survey for 3, 5 and 12 year old children\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Upper Tier LA Name</th>\n<th>Population</th>\n<th>Examined</th>\n<th>Mean DMFT</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<td colspan=\"3\">3 years of age (2013 survey)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>England</th>\n<td>665744</td>\n<td>53814</td>\n<td>0.36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<td>2350</td>\n<td>307</td>\n<td>0.74</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<td colspan=\"3\">5 years of age (2012 survey)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>England</th>\n<td>635925</td>\n<td>133516</td>\n<td>0.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<td>1965</td>\n<td>279</td>\n<td>1.43</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<td colspan=\"3\">12 years of age (2009 survey)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>England</th>\n<td>608460</td>\n<td>89442</td>\n<td>0.74</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<td>1440</td>\n<td>329</td>\n<td>0.81</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Improvement of oral hygiene, particularly for the very young in Reading, should be a serious consideration to help give local young people the best start in life.

Numbers are too small for reliable analysis at a local authority level.</p>\n<p>Figure 2 below shows the number of children with 2 or more DMF teeth as a percentage of the surveyed sample by Berkshire electoral ward.

Up to the age of 2, service uptake is very low, possibly with parents perceiving that there are few if any benefits of taking their child to a dental practice before teeth have erupted. For the early teens, both parents and children are concerned about the development of their teeth, especially whether they need orthodontic treatment as the secondary (adult) dentition replaces the primary (baby) teeth.</p>\n<p>The drop in uptake in early adulthood corresponds with the introduction of patient co- payments and for the elderly factors influencing service usage include perceived need, many of the elderly having none of their own teeth, and again, co-payments.</p>\n<p>A growing oral health problem is oral cancer. The lifetime risk of developing oral cancer and pharyngeal cancer in Europeans is estimated at 1.85% for men and 0.37% for women, with 250 new cases in the Thames Valley per year and 38 new cases per year across Reading, West Berkshire and Wokingham. Although the number of cases appears slow, the prognosis is generally poor. The five-year survival rate for oral cancer is lower than for other more common cancers, for example cervical, breast or prostate cancers.</p>\n<p>Factors associated with an increased risk of oral cancer include: smoking, marijuana usage, alcohol consumption, betel quid chewing, poor diet, human papilloma virus (HPV) and poor oral health. The changing epidemiology, particularly the earlier presentation of the condition is thought primarily to be due to sexually practices but the long-term factors, especially the use of tobacco and alcohol remain central.</p>\n<p>As highlighted previously, the growing size of the elderly population have increasing dental need. Previous success in care arrangements has allowed this subgroup to retain more of their own teeth and for longer. Many of the teeth are heavily restored and the care needed to address any problems arising is complicated by other factors including patient co-morbidities, not least those individuals suffering from dementia.</p>\n<p>A recently published report (Fatania et al., 2013) on a pilot study exploring dental care in care homes across Berkshire highlighted a number of issues. Care home staff reported that with other work pressures, oral health was not a priority and reinforced that patients with dementia were particularly challenging. With an ageing population, the number of elderly patients in care and nursing homes is on the rise.</p>\n<p>Programmes are being developed to help support dental personnel to provide care, for example dealing with issues of consent and complex medical histories. There is also an appreciation of the potential role of a wider audience can play in helping promote the contribution that good oral health can make and which recognises the multi-disciplinary nature of care. This would include helping care home staff to support the delivery of care and to increase their confidence when assisting with oral hygiene.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>There are numerous policy documents that have guided the development of arrangements to improve oral health at a national level. These include those associated with the determinants and those affecting care service delivery. Examples include the document &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/367563/DBOHv32014OCTMainDocument_3.pdf\">Delivering Better Oral Health. An evidence-based toolkit for prevention</a>&#8216; (Department of Health, 2014) aimed at ensuring that the dental profession were aware of current best practice, and programmes aimed at improving access to services.</p>\n<p>More recently NICE have published guidance on how Local Authorities can best use address oral health <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph55\">&#8216;Oral health: Local authorities and partners&#8217;</a> (NICE, 2014) which makes recommendations on undertaking oral health needs assessments, developing a local strategy on oral health and delivering community-based interventions and activities.</p>\n<p>Locally, the former Berkshire Primary Care Trusts have developed the provision of care aimed at improving access by commissioning increased services and supporting the development of specific oral health promotion schemes such as the &#8216;Brushing for Life&#8217; programme currently operating in Reading, Slough and West of Berkshire Local Authority areas.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Although oral health has improved over the past five years there remain disparities within the population. Reading local authority has levels of decay that are higher than the average for England.</p>\n<p>A significant number of very young children are experiencing difficulties arising from poor oral health that indicate a need to improve efforts aimed at reducing the factors influencing disease and its sequela in children and supporting parents in a targeted manner.</p>\n<p>The increasing prevalence of HPV is leading to an increase in the number of oral cancers diagnosed. Working with young people and informing them of oral cancer as well as all of the other risks of contracting a sexually transmitted disease may help to reduce these figures.</p>\n<p>Regarding oral cancer, patients may present to their GPs with symptoms. Increasing the training for general practitioners in the early recognition of oral cancer and urgent referral to dental services may be crucial in improving patient&#8217;s prognoses which means working with the Health Education England. This work stresses the importance of building close collaborative working between health care professions.</p>\n<p>The problems of poor oral health are growing within the elderly population. Educating and supporting all care workers about the role of good oral hygiene and how good oral health can contribute to the qualities of life as well will be essential in maintaining physical as well as mental health in these patients.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>While overall, oral health has seen significantly improvements in England over the last few decades, marked inequalities persist. Globally, nationally and locally, there is substantial evidence highlighting that people in the poorer and more deprived areas suffer worse oral health when compared to those living in more affluent areas.</p>\n<p>The problems of inequalities in disease experience are further compounded by the inequalities in service uptake; those with greater clinical need tend to use services less. These issues arise for a number of reasons including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variation in perceived importance of good oral hygiene</li>\n<li>Low education and literacy levels</li>\n<li>Cultural differences and language barriers</li>\n<li>Financial restrictions</li>\n<li>Fear</li>\n<li>Low awareness of the risk factors for oral diseases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Priority group who are most likely to experience poor oral health and who are most likely to benefit from preventive interventions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early years and parents</li>\n<li>Vulnerable adults</li>\n<li>Older people</li>\n<li>Prisoners</li>\n<li>Adults with learning difficulties</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/service gaps?</h2>\n<p>The current unmet needs are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The prevalence of children with dental decay highlights that oral health issues have already arisen at 5 years of age. The &#8216;Brushing for Life&#8217; programme in place in Reading is designed to help address this and lead to improvements in both overall levels of oral health and reduce inequalities. This programme could also be linked into programmes aimed at helping increase attendance for care.</li>\n<li>The growing oral health needs of the elderly population will require appropriate solutions. Work needs to be undertaken to help quantify the needs of this growing section of the population. While currently all new entrants to a care or nursing home have a medical assessment, dental assessments are not included.</li>\n<li>The changing epidemiology of oral cancer, and the growing evidence of an association with HPV exposure, suggests that good opportunities would arise through collaboration with the Sexual Health team. Work is also required to understand how patients with the oral health problems are initially accessing primary care services</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity &#8211; adult &amp; child</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/smoking/\">Smoking</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cancer/\">Cancer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/sexual-health/\">Sexual Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/general-wellbeing/\">General Wellbeing</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Fatania et al.

Obesity is a significant factor contributing to the rise in incidence of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease and some forms of cancer.</p>\n<p>The greatest risk of being overweight or obese is Type 2 diabetes (see Diabetes JSNA section for further information), which is a progressive disease with serious co-morbidities including heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputations.</p>\n<p>In adults, a person&#8217;s weight is considered in relation to height in order to assess if it falls within a healthy range. Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres, squared. &#8216;Overweight&#8217; is defined as having a &#8216;Body Mass Index&#8217; (BMI) of 25-29.9. &#8216;Obesity&#8217; is defined as having a &#8216;BMI&#8217; greater than 30. In Black, Asian and other ethnic minority groups, because the incidence of long-term health conditions including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke is up to 6 times higher (and they occur from a younger age) than in the white European population, lower BMI thresholds for the prevention of ill health have been set. For Asian (South Asian and Chinese), Black African and African-Caribbean populations, National Institute for Clinical Excellence (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/\">NICE</a>) recommends using thresholds of 23 kg/m2 to indicate increased risk and 27.5 kg/m2 to indicate high risk. These thresholds should act as a trigger for action to prevent type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>Waist circumference is another commonly used measure of adiposity. The World Health Organisation has advised that an individual&#8217;s risk of obesity-related co-morbidities is more accurately described by considering BMI and waist circumference in combination. People of South Asian Origin are particularly prone to central adiposity, which in turn presents a health risk at a lower BMI.</p>\n<p>In children, weight status if measured using age and sex appropriate growth charts. The <a href=\"http://www.noo.org.uk/\">National Obesity Observatory</a> notes that in England the British 1990 (UK90) growth reference charts should be used, to determine the weight status of an individual child and for population surveillance purposes.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The causes of obesity are complex and multifaceted. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/287937/07-1184x-tackling-obesities-future-choices-report.pdf\">The Foresight Report (2007</a>) refers to a &#8220;complex web of societal and biological factors that have, in recent decades, exposed our inherent human vulnerability to weight gain&#8221;. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biology: the influence of genetics and ill health;</li>\n<li>Activity environment: for example, a decision to cycle to work may be influenced by road safety, air pollution or provision of a cycle shelter.</li>\n<li>Physical Activity levels during the day.</li>\n<li>Societal influences: such as the media, education, peer pressure or culture.</li>\n<li>Individual psychology: for example the drive for particular foods or physical activity patterns or preferences.</li>\n<li>Food environment: for example the availability and quality of fruit and vegetables near home may influence a decision to eat these foods.</li>\n<li>Food consumption: the quality and quantity (portion sizes) of food and frequency of eating.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The risk of obesity can be passed down through generations due to both biological and behavioural influences. Malnutrition, both fetal or in early childhood (for example due to poor maternal nutrition), can affect gene function. Babies born with a low birth weight or who are &#8216;short for age&#8217; can be at increased risk of overweight and obesity in later life, especially if exposed to an obesiogenic environment.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a mother who is obese or who has either pre-existing or gestational diabetes when she becomes pregnant will predispose her child to carrying an increased number of fat cells which is associated with obesity and other metabolic diseases.</p>\n<p>Children often &#8216;inherit&#8217; socio-economic status, dietary and physical activity behaviours and norms from their families. Both maternal and paternal obesity have been identified as risk factors for childhood obesity and the effects are additive (i.e. the risk is even greater if both parents are obese).</p>\n<p>Obesity prevalence has a strong association with socio-economic inequalities, prevalence being highest amongst those from poorer backgrounds. An increased risk of obesity has also been identified in subgroups such as migrant and indigenous children; this is thought to be due to them rapidly trying to adapt to a different culture and having poor access to public health information.</p>\n<p>There is little data available nationally on obesity prevalence in British Minority Ethnic (BME) groups living in the UK. However, from the data available, women from Black African groups appear to have the highest prevalence of obesity and men from Chinese and Bangladeshi groups have the lowest. Women appear to have a higher prevalence in virtually all minority ethnic groups, particularly amongst Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Black African communities. These differences have been linked to diet, lower levels of physical activity and socio-economic status. In some cultures, the perception of what is a healthy weight varies, particularly in relation to children and women. Overweight and obesity can be seen as a sign of strength or wealth, which perpetuates the prevalence within these communities. Information in the ethnicity chapter of the JSNA describes the growth in South Asian and Black / Black African communities in Reading over the last 10 years; which should be considered when planning obesity service provision.</p>\n<p>In children, data from the National Child Measuring Programme broken down by ethnicity shows that in Reception, obesity is most prevalent in Black African, Black Other and Bangladeshi boys. By year 6, boys from all BME groups have a higher prevalence of obesity than white British. In girls in Reception and Year 6, obesity prevalence is highest in Black African and Black Other groups.</p>\n<p>Although little data is available, people with physical or learning disabilities tend to have a higher propensity to obesity and lower physical activity levels than the general population.

Bariatric surgery may also be recommended as first line treatment for patients with a BMI of 50+</p>\n<p>Based on Central Southern Commissioning Support Unit data, Berkshire has seen a 32% increase of spending over the last 5 years (2010/2011-2014/2015) on initial bariatric surgery procedures. The procedures have moved away from the Gastric band to Gastric bypass, which is more clinically effective. The cost of bypass has remained relatively stable for this period, but has seen a very slight drop in cost of the procedures from 2010/2011-2014/15.</p>\n<p>Levels of bariatric surgery and expenditure in Reading by Clinical Commissioning Group.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Levels of bariatric surgery and expenditure in Reading by Clinical Commissioning Group\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>CCG Name</th>\n<th>2013-14 Admissions</th>\n<th>2013-14</p>\n<p>Cost</th>\n<th>2014-15 Admissions</th>\n<th>2014-15</p>\n<p>Cost</th>\n<th>2015-16 Admissions</p>\n<p>(Month 1-6)</th>\n<th>2015-16</p>\n<p>Cost</th>\n<th>Total Admissions</th>\n<th>Total Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>North &amp; West Reading CCG</th>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>£41,183</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>£40,494</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>£45,242</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>£126,919</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>South Reading CCG</th>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>£32,989</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>£53,215</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>£21,351</td>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>£107,555</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Prepared by Berkshire West Informatics.</p>\n<h2>Current activities and services:</h2>\n<h3>Children:</h3>\n<h4>Breast-feeding peer support groups</h4>\n<p>Breastfeeding contributes to the health of mother and child in both the short and long term and provides all the nutrients a baby needs. There is mounting evidence that breast feeding can help to protect against overweight and obesity in childhood (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/elena/titles/bbc/breastfeeding_childhood_obesity/en/\">WHO 2014</a>). Current UK policy is to promote exclusive breastfeeding (feeding only breast milk) for the first 6 months, continuing for as long as the mother and baby wish while gradually introducing a more varied diet. Breast-feeding peer support groups in Reading are listed on the <a href=\"https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/sample-page/\">Breastfeeding Network</a> website.</p>\n<p><strong>Health Visitors </strong>&#8211; The Health Visiting Service workforce consists of Specialist Community Public Health Nurses (SCPHN) and teams who provide expert information, assessments and interventions for babies, children and families including first time mothers and fathers and families with complex needs. Health visitors help to empower parents to make decisions that affect their family&#8217;s health and wellbeing and their role is central to improving the health outcomes of populations and reducing inequalities. This includes advice on; Breastfeeding (initiation and duration), healthy weight, healthy nutrition and physical activity.</p>\n<p><strong>School Nurses</strong> &#8211; The School Nursing (SN) Service in delivers an evidence based service that provides public health interventions and health care support to school age children and their families to enable children to make the most of their education and wider social opportunities to improve health and health outcomes for children and families. The SN service leads, co-ordinates and provides services for children and young people as set out in the Healthy Child Programme 5 &#8211; 19 years, including working with others to deliver universal services. Priorities include; Weight and height measurements to be offered to all children attending state funded primary school children who are in Reception Year (age 5) and Year 6 (aged 10, 11) in accordance with NCMP guidance. Also, SN offer tier 1 targeted support and advice to families with overweight/obese children on diet /healthy lifestyles and onward referral if required for children in Reception.</p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s Get Going</strong>: Public Health commissions a weight management and healthy lifestyle service for children aged 7-12 years which offers family based advice on healthy eating, behaviour change and a practical physical activity element in local schools and a community site. The programme follows <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/\">NICE</a> guidance on community based weight management interventions for children.</p>\n<h3>Adults:</h3>\n<p>A wide range of opportunities to be physically active are available in Reading as detailed in the physical activity module. These include a <a href=\"https://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk/walkfinder/south-east/reading-walks-programme\">health walks programme</a>, exercise on referral programme, cycle training (for adults and children) and the &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.beatthestreet.me/\">Beat the Street&#8217;</a> walking and cycling project.</p>\n<h4>Tier 2 weight management:</h4>\n<p>Eat 4 Health is a tier 2, evidence-based programme commissioned across West Berkshire for adults (over 16 years) with a BMI below 25. The programme includes health eating, behaviour change and a physical activity element as recommended in NICE guidance.</p>\n<h4>Tier 4 Bariatric Surgery:</h4>\n<p>Commissioned by NHS England and provided at Royal Berkshire Hospital for Berkshire.</p>\n<p>NICE recommends that bariatric surgery should be considered for patients who meet the following criteria:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Patients have a BMI of 40kg/m2 or more, or between 35kg/m2 and 40kg/m2 and other significant disease (for example, type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure) that could be improved if they lost weight</li>\n<li>All appropriate non-surgical measures have been tried but the person has not achieved or maintained adequate, clinically beneficial weight loss</li>\n<li>The patient has been receiving or will receive intensive management in a tier 3 service.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-lives-healthy-people-a-call-to-action-on-obesity-in-england\">Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A call to action on obesity in England</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/start-active-stay-active-a-report-on-physical-activity-from-the-four-home-countries-chief-medical-officers\">Start Active, Stay Active, A report on physical activity for health from the four home countries&#8217; Chief Medical Officers</a> (Department of Health, 2011).

Obesity has been likened to smoking in terms of its associated disease burden (&#8216;<a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4074426\">Securing good health for the whole population&#8217;</a>; Wanless 2004) significantly increasing the risk of numerous long term conditions including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Obesity is also known to negatively impact on educational attainment, mental health, respiratory and musculoskeletal disorders and for those with a BMI over 40, it can shorten a person&#8217;s lifespan by 8-10 years.</p>\n<p>Obesity has an estimated socio-economic impact totalling an estimated £27 billion a year.</p>\n<p>In Reading, £234,474 was spent on admissions for bariatric surgery; this equates to £1,523 per patient. In contrast, sending a person to a 10 week, local authority tier 2 programme before their weight becomes severe enough to necessitate surgery would cost less than £160 per person.</p>\n<h3>Prevention and early intervention are key strategies for reversing the tide of obesity.</h3>\n<p>Due to the multi-faceted causes of overweight and obesity, a cohesive approach supported by multi-agency working and tailored to the needs of the local population is needed in order to reverse the trend of rising obesity prevalence. Interventions at all levels from primary prevention through to surgical intervention with clear referral pathways play an important role in tackling overweight and obesity at an individual and population level as described below:</p>\n<h4>Tier 1 / Primary prevention &#8211; Commissioned by Local Authorities,</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Raising awareness of why a healthy weight is important, what a healthy weight is for adults and children and how to maintain this. For example through supporting National campaigns (e.g. Change 4 Life, One You), the <a href=\"http://www.hscic.gov.uk/ncmp\">NCMP</a> and a <a href=\"http://makingeverycontactcount.co.uk/\">Making Every Contact Count</a>-style approach to raising the issue.</li>\n<li>Action throughout the life course to enable and encourage people to move more on a daily basis through structured or unstructured physical activity, in line with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-physical-activity-guidelines\">Chief Medical Officer Guidelines</a>.  This includes active play, walking, cycling and other forms of active travel, exercise and sport; both through healthy school / workplace initiatives and during leisure time. In addition, encouraging children and adults to minimise prolonged periods of sedentary behaviour such as screen time.</li>\n<li>Appropriate information about healthy weight, the impact of maternal obesity and appropriate infant feeding; ideally given to parents before conception, but also during pregnancy and in infancy may help to reduce the risk of excess weight or inappropriate feeding behaviours during a child&#8217;s early developmental stages.</li>\n<li>Action to ensure that residents can access affordable, culturally acceptable, healthy food inside and outside the home and know how to prepare basic meals from scratch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Tier 2 services: Commissioned by Local Authorities.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Lifestyle based programmes for adults and children in community settings, which adhere to NICE guidance; including advice on healthy eating, physical activity opportunities and behaviour change.</li>\n<li>These programmes should aim to reach people who have become overweight, with a view to preventing them from becoming obese and suffering from the associated increased risk of co-morbidities and economic impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Tier 3 services: Commissioned by CCGs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Specialist interventions delivered by a multidisciplinary team for individuals who have higher BMIs, co-morbidities or have generally been unsuccessful in undergoing tier 1 or 2 interventions. Tier 3 interventions will include Dietetic, physical activity and psychological support services.</li>\n<li>Tier 3 services can help to reduce the number of patients who go on to require costly, invasive bariatric surgery and provide intensive lifestyle support for those who do undergo surgery to support the behaviour changes required for the procedure to have long-term success.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Tier 4 services: Commissioned by NHS England.</h4>\n<p>There are 3 main procedures used in the UK; these are adjustable gastric banding, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. In cases of morbid obesity, surgery is often the most effective intervention for achieving sustained weight loss; however, the risks associated with the procedure and occurrence of adverse events following surgery are much greater than with non-surgical interventions.</p>\n<p>Clear, consistent, two-directional referral pathways need to be developed between providers of different tiers of service in order to ensure that people follow an appropriate and effective programme of long term support to help them achieve and maintain a healthier weight.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Reading mirrors National trends in terms of the relationship between obesity prevalence and deprivation. Obesity prevalence has a strong association with socio-economic inequalities, the prevalence being highest amongst those from poorer backgrounds. Men and women in unskilled, manual occupations are more likely to be obese than those in professional occupations. Work to prevent and reduce obesity needs to take account of and be accessible to those living in deprivation in order to help narrow the inequality gap.</p>\n<p>Obesity prevalence varies with age; the lowest levels in adults are seen in the 16-24 age group, after which, prevalence increases with age, up until 75+ years, where there is a decline. This pattern is evident in both males and females (<a href=\"https://data.gov.uk/dataset/health_survey_for_england\">Health Survey for England 2008-2012</a>).</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>Currently the prevalence of overweight and obesity amongst adults and children in Reading by far exceeds the capacity of intervention programmes to tackle the issue. A multi-organisational approach encouraging societal movement towards healthy eating and physical activity is required. This needs to start in early years settings and extend across the lifespan to help ensure that behaviours which support the attainment of a healthy weight are established from a young age and supported by parents, carers, in educational settings and by healthcare professionals.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are tier 2 weight management programmes commissioned for school aged children and adults in Reading, but places are limited. In addition, a range of active play, active travel and physical activity / sporting opportunities support the maintenance of a healthy weight throughout life (see physical activity chapter of JSNA).</p>\n<p>There are currently no commissioned programmes for parents / carers focused on healthy growth and weight for children in early years settings; although the opportunity for families and young people to be supported and get advice on healthy child growth is accessible through health visiting and school nursing services. Physical activity, play and some food related sessions are timetabled in children&#8217;s centres.</p>\n<p>There are currently no dedicated healthy lifestyle / weight management programmes targeted at teenagers, this is an important life stage where young people are becoming increasingly more independent and making choices about their eating and exercise habits.</p>\n<p>There is currently a gap in the provision of Tier 3 (non-surgical, specialist) obesity services across Berkshire; which are recommended as a pre-surgical intervention for a 12-24 month period. Tier 3 services include psychological behaviour change, Dietetic and Physical Activity elements.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a tier 3 intervention may prevent the need for referral to tier 4. However, even for patients who are subsequently referred for surgery, the long-term success of their treatment still depends on their ability to make lifestyle changes, which can be supported through a tier 3 programme.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>International migration is a key driver of population growth in Reading, and the number of people coming to live in Reading is considerably higher than in neighbouring boroughs. Consequently, Reading has a higher proportion of residents born outside of the UK than the South East and the UK as a whole. Local Authorities are required to consider wider factors that will impact on their communities&#8217; health and wellbeing, and this includes examining needs of residents born outside of the UK.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>A range of ONS indicators consistently point to considerably higher rates of net international migration, and people born outside of the UK who are resident in Reading than across the South East and the UK (see Figure 1). Figure 1 demonstrates that these are established trends, with the estimated rate of non-British Nationals in the population demonstrably higher in Reading than elsewhere since at least 2010. Both peaked in 2011, but following a slight decrease in 2012 and 2013, increased again in 2014.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Estimates of Non-British Nationals per 1,000 Resident Population</p>\n<p>Source: Office of National Statistics, Migration Indicators Tool (August 2015).</p>\n<h2>Reading residents born outside of the UK</h2>\n<p>An estimated 40,000 people living in Reading in 2014 were born outside of the UK, representing 25.32% of the total population. Table 1 shows the number of individuals born in the EU, the rest of Europe and outside of Europe and as a percentage of the total population.</p>\n<p>Local authority level data for Reading suggests that recent population increases have been driven by international migration (49.5%) and natural change (50.5%). Net international migration into Reading in the year to mid-2014 was 1,583 (1,583 more people moved to Reading from outside of the UK, than moved out of Reading to areas outside of the UK). These additional people accounted for 0.98% of the total population in mid-2014.

The report points to a statistically significant increase of residents in the UK population who were born in EU2 countries &#8211; Romania and Bulgaria &#8211; from 34,000 to 234,000 between 2007 and 2014. By contrast, the proportion of non-EU nationals in the overall population decreased, driven by a decline in the number of nationals from the &#8216;Rest of World&#8217; category (i.e. not Europe or Asia).</p>\n<p>Home Office analysis of the Annual Population Survey for 2012-13 found that a small majority of residents born outside of the UK originally come to the UK for economic reasons (26%).

(ONS, 2015; Cooper, Campbell, Patel and Simmonds, 2014).</p>\n<h2>Internal Migration to Reading</h2>\n<p>Net internal migration (migration within the UK) for the South East indicates that almost 20,000 additional people were living in areas of the South East in 2014, after moving from other areas of the UK, accounting for almost a quarter of the annual increase in total South East population. In the same period, Reading saw a net decrease in internal migration of 1,493 people, indicating that more people left Reading for other parts of the UK than came to Reading (see Population Change module). This is similar to trends seen in London, which saw a net decrease of 55,000 people to June 2013; like London, Reading saw a high inflow into the area, but an even higher outflow (Table 5).</p>\n<p>Table 5: Internal Migration Inflows and Outflows in Reading and South-East</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Internal Migration Inflows and Outflows in Reading and South-East\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Area</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">In-flow</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Out-flow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number</td>\n<td>% of mid-2013 pop</td>\n<td>Number</td>\n<td>% of mid-2013 pop</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading</td>\n<td>11,847</td>\n<td>7.44%</td>\n<td>13,340</td>\n<td>8.38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>South East</td>\n<td>242,323</td>\n<td>2.76%</td>\n<td>222,328</td>\n<td>2.53%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: ONS (Mid-Year Estimate (Mid-Year Estimates )for Population Change for local authorities)</p>\n<p>ONS analysis of internal London migration suggests that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Young people move out of London for education</li>\n<li>Graduates move into London for work</li>\n<li>From their 30&#8217;s onwards, more people leave London (for more affordable housing, or for social or environmental reasons, such as social and educational environment for children).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As Reading has a strong economy and low unemployment, as well as a large university, it is possible to infer that Reading may be experiencing similar trends, with young people moving into Reading for work, or graduates remaining in the town after their studies are complete (ONS, 2014). In contrast to the trends seen in London, however, Reading has seen an increase in the number of children in the population, suggesting that those moving to improve their children&#8217;s social and environmental conditions may remain within the Borough.</p>\n<h2>Asylum Applications</h2>\n<p>There was a national increase of 10% on the number of asylum applications to the UK between 2014 and 2015, but overall numbers remained relatively low number compared to the peak number received in 2002.The largest number of applications for asylum came from nationals of Eritrea, Pakistan, and Syria. There are no reliable sources of data on Asylum Seekers at a local authority level.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>The Marmot Review (2010) sets out the impact of inequalities on health and wellbeing and its findings and recommendations are recognised by local and national government. The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents\">Equalities Act 2010</a> legally protects individuals from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. Under the act, public sector organisations such as Local Authorities have an obligation to take notice of the need to reduce inequalities that result from socioeconomic disadvantage (Equality Act, 2010). Reading has an ethnically diverse population, and Reading Borough Council has a responsibility to ensure that no groups face disadvantage as a result of their ethnic identity. Reading Borough Council refers to this obligation in its Equality Objectives (RBC, 2015) and describes the Local Authority&#8217;s ongoing commitment to celebrating and respecting diversity in Reading as a key to the Borough&#8217;s success. In addition, as part of their public health responsibilities, Local Authorities are required to consider wider factors that will impact on their communities&#8217; health and wellbeing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223842/Statutory-Guidance-on-Joint-Strategic-Needs-Assessments-and-Joint-Health-and-Wellbeing-Strategies-March-2013.pdf\">(Department of Health 2013)</a>.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>High net international migration has resulted in a higher than average proportion of those born outside of the UK in the resident population. These are likely to be mostly working age people, with the largest proportions born in Poland, India, Pakistan, Republic of Ireland and Germany, and they are more likely to be resident in areas near the town centre. A recent increase in migrants into the UK from Lithuania and Bulgaria have also been identified in Reading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>High inflow and outflow of internal migration has resulted in a net decrease in population, as young working age people move to Reading to work but move away, seeking more affordable housing and better social and environmental location.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Although there is little evidence that immigration to the UK has increased inequality (Equality Trust, 2015; Card, 2009), more work, including a review of relevant research evidence, is needed to understand particular health needs of particular migrant populations in Reading. For example, there is some evidence of high levels of depression, anxiety and problematic alcohol use amongst Polish migrant workers, as well as higher attendances at hospital Emergency Departments for problems usually treated in primary care (Lakasing and Mirza, 2009; Leaman, Rysdale and Webber, 2006).</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>As the population becomes more ethnically diverse, organisations will need to continue to be mindful of the need to provide culturally competent and sensitive services to ensure that health services remain accessible and responsive to the people who need them (see population change module). As mentioned above, some migrant populations may have specific health needs that require targeted interventions. Further investigation is needed to determine where this is the case.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/population-change/\">Population Change</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/ethnicity/\">Ethnicity</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Card, D.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The World Health Organisation defines &#8220;mental health&#8221; as a state of wellbeing in which every individual realises their own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to their own community (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2014).</p>\n<p>This positive dimension of mental health is further stressed in their definition of health as, &#8220;a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8216;Mental ill health&#8217;, mental illness or &#8216;mental health problems&#8217; on the other hand, covers a very wide spectrum, from the worries and grief experienced as part of everyday life to the most bleak, suicidal depression or complete loss of touch with everyday reality (Mindful employer, 2014). <a href=\"http://www.mindfulemployer.net/managers/what-mental-health/\">http://www.mindfulemployer.net/managers/what-mental-health/</a></p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>There are many issues that impact on our mental health including our physical health, our social situation, our living environment and/or genetic factors. This entails that everybody is at risk of developing a mental health problem at any time during their lives. As highlighted by Gofal (2015), the most important thing to realise is that the majority of the people who experience mental health problems do recover or learn to manage them and still lead meaningful and fulfilled lives.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Mental health problems&#8217;, &#8216;mental illness&#8217; and &#8216;mental ill-health&#8217; are all common terms that are used to refer to the full spectrum of diagnosed clinical conditions such as depression/unipolar disorder, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Symptoms of mental health problems have traditionally been divided into groups called either &#8216;neurotic&#8217; or &#8216;psychotic&#8217; symptoms. &#8216;Neurotic&#8217; covers those symptoms which can be regarded as extreme forms of &#8216;normal&#8217; emotional experiences such as depression, anxiety or panic. Conditions formerly referred to as &#8216;neuroses&#8217; are now more frequently called &#8216;common mental health problems,&#8217; although this does not always mean they are less severe than conditions with psychotic symptoms.</p>\n<p>Less common are &#8216;psychotic&#8217; symptoms which interfere with a person&#8217;s perception of reality and may include hallucinations, delusions or paranoia, with the person seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling or believing things that no one else does. Psychotic symptoms or &#8216;psychoses&#8217; are often associated with &#8216;severe mental health problems.&#8217;</p>\n<p>However, there is no sharp distinction between the symptoms of common and severe mental health problems. It is important to remember that some illnesses feature both neurotic and psychotic symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Facts, figures and trends</h2>\n<p>The department of Health&#8217;s strategy, &#8220;Achieving Better Access to Mental Health Services by 2020&#8221; notes that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each year, about one in four of us in the United Kingdom will have a mental health problem (McManus S, Meltzer H, Brugha T et al. 2009); this can range from a short spell of depression or anxiety through to severe and persistent conditions that are massively disruptive, frightening and life threatening for those who experience them. The department of Health&#8217;s strategy, &#8220;Achieving Better Access to Mental Health Services by 2020&#8221; notes that:</li>\n<li>Mental health problems can also have a terrible impact on people&#8217;s physical health (Nicholson A, Kuper H and Hemingway H , 2006);</li>\n<li>For young people, mental illness is strongly associated with behaviours that pose a risk to their health, such as smoking, drug and alcohol abuse and risky sexual behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research also shows that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the UK, mental health problems are responsible for the largest burden of disease- 28% of the total burden, compared to 16% each for cancer and heart disease (Ferrari et.al, 2013)</li>\n<li>Around 50% of women with perinatal mental health problems are not identified or treated.</li>\n<li>Postnatal depression in fathers has been associated with emotional and behavioural problems in their child (Ramchandani P.G et .al. 2008)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Reading, excess under- 75 mortality rates in adults with serious mental illness has slightly decreased since 2009/2010 and at 375.9/100,000, it does not differ significantly from the national and regional averages (figure 1).</p>\n<h3>Depression</h3>\n<p>Although the recorded prevalence of depression appears lower than the national average, Reading has seen an increase in the year 2013/2014, compared to 2012/2013. The same can be said for the number of social care mental health clients receiving services in the locality (Figs 2-5). In line with the WHO forecasts that by 2020, depression will be the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease (WHO, 2001); the number of people in Reading aged 18-64 predicted to have a mental health problem will see an on-going rise by 2030 (figure 6).</p>\n<p>Figure 1.Excess under-75 mortality rate in adults with serious mental illness in Reading(18-74 years)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5181/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) for April 2013 &#8211;

This report notes that, &#8220;one in three of the 100,000 people who die avoidably each year have a mental illness. We know that people with mental illness are three times more likely to develop diabetes and twice as likely to die from heart disease. More than 40% of all tobacco is smoked by people with mental health problems&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council in partnership with the Reading Youth Cabinet designed the booklet &#8220;Off the Record&#8221; to raise awareness of common mental health issues and to provide practical tips and information in order to help young people look after their own emotional wellbeing.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BHFT) provide a Talking Therapies service to the adult population of Reading in line with the Department of Health&#8217;s &#8216;Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. The focus of the service is on primary care, to meet the needs of clients experiencing common mental health problems. In 2014/2015, recovery rates were above the national average for Reading.

All Rights Reserved</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Mental health is fundamental to the good quality of life and productivity of the population. The health, social and economic benefits are not just the result of the absence of mental illness but are also owing to positive mental health (pressman &amp; Cen, 2006).</p>\n<p>A public health approach will include enhancing the protective factors for mental health, which is not entirely equivalent to the absence of risk factors for mental illness. Some of the factors associated with positive mental health include; personality traits, various demographic factors, income and socioeconomic status, emotional and social literacy, levels of trust, reciprocity, participation and cohesion within communities, purposeful activity including work, self-esteem, and values such as altruism (Abbott RA, Ploubidis GB, Croudace TJ, et al 2008).</p>\n<p>Positive mental health has also been associated with enhanced psychosocial functioning, improved learning and academic achievement, increased participation in community life, reduced sickness absence, improved productivity, reduced risk-taking behaviour, improved physical health, reduced mortality, reduced health inequality as well as recovery from mental illness (NICE, 2009).</p>\n<h3>The need to secure positive mental health and resilience</h3>\n<p>A public health approach considers protective factors for mental health as well as risk factors for mental illness. Important interventions include high-quality maternal care, nurturing upbringing and safe early experiences. Examples of specific interventions are parental training, school-based and work-based mental health promotion programmes.</p>\n<p>The emphasis on well-being, community cohesion and productive, long working lives requires strategies to encourage and empower individuals to secure positive mental health.</p>\n<h3>Mental health problems have multiple determinants; prevention needs to be a multipronged effort</h3>\n<p>Social, biological and neurological sciences have provided substantial insight into the role of risk and protective factors in the developmental pathways to mental disorders and poor mental health. Biological, psychological, social and societal risk and protective factors and their interactions have been identified across the lifespan from as early as foetal life. Many of these factors are malleable and therefore potential targets for prevention and promotion measures. High comorbidity among mental disorders and their inter-relationship with physical illnesses and social problems stress the need for integrated public health policies, targeting clusters of related problems, common determinants, early stages of multi-problem trajectories and populations at multiple risks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, given the high prevalence rate and associated negative effects of mental health problems, the need to prevent their development has become essential. One means of achieving this goal has been the implementation of prevention programs in schools. Masia-Warner, Nangle and Hansen (2006), reiterate this in their argument that schools are viewed as the ideal environment in which to present these prevention initiatives as they have unparalleled contact with young people and therefore represent a place in which the majority can be reached.</p>\n<h3>What are the key health inequalities?</h3>\n<p>Mental illness is an important cause of social inequality, violence and unemployment as well as a consequence (FPH, 2010). Mental health problems in childhood and adolescence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce educational achievement and employability (NICE, 2009) and also</li>\n<li>Increase the risk of impaired relationships, drug and alcohol misuse, violence and crime (Richards M, Abbott R, 2009)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The experience of mental illness further exacerbates social inequalities because of its impact on employment and housing status. Half of all mental illness starts by the age of 14 and 75% by mid 20s (Kessler RC et al. 2007)</p>\n<p>Low income, debt, violence, stressful life events and unemployment are key risk factors for mental illness (McCrone et. al. 2008). The two-way relationship between mental illness and social inequality can prove difficult to unravel with common epidemiological approaches. Levels of deprivation are a key determinant of mental health disorders &#8211; mental health problems are more likely to be seen in people living in deprived areas.</p>\n<p>People from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities tend to have poorer mental health and have more difficulty in accessing mental health care than the majority of the population (NIMHE, 2003).</p>\n<p>Data published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) in February 2013 showed that mortality among mental health service users aged 19 and over in England was 4,008 per 100,000 (83,390 deaths in total) compared to the general population rate of 1,122 per 100,000. This mortality rate was 3.6 times the rate of the general population in 2010/11.</p>\n<p>People in contact with specialist mental health services had a higher death rate for most causes of death, but in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nearly four times the general population rate of deaths from diseases of the respiratory system (at 142.2 per 100,000 service users, compared with 37.3 per 100,000 in the general population);</li>\n<li>Just over four times the general population rate of deaths from diseases of the digestive system (at 126.1 per 100,000, compared with 28.5 per 100,000 in the general population);</li>\n<li>2.5 times the general population rate of deaths from diseases of the circulatory system (at 254.0 per 100,000 compared with 101.1 per 100,000 in the general population).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Within these disease areas, specific conditions that accounted for a high proportion of deaths among service users (under the age of 75) were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diseases of the liver; at 7.6 percent of deaths (1,430 in total);</li>\n<li>Ischaemic heart diseases; at 9.9 percent of all deaths (1,880 in total).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<h3>Co-ordination with preventative and health improvement services</h3>\n<p>Mental wellbeing is a fundamental component of good health and its lack underpins many physical diseases, unhealthy lifestyles and social inequalities in health.</p>\n<p>The latest public health and mental health strategies recognize that mental health and physical health should be treated with &#8216;parity of esteem&#8217;. In order to achieve this parity, there is a need to enhance knowledge and skills relating to the mental health components of public health practice.</p>\n<p>People with mental health problems still need to be better supported to live healthy lives, making real progress towards bringing life expectancy on a par with the rest of the population.</p>\n<p>Training and support for frontline workers to enable them to spot the early signs of mental health problems, provide initial help and signpost people accordingly remain inadequate in many services.</p>\n<p>In Reading, MotherTongue, a multilingual counselling service, conducted a pilot project with IAPT in 2015, where they found that due to the higher numbers of BME clients accessing their service, there has been an increased demand for interpreters in the South Reading area.</p>\n<h3>Actions across the life course</h3>\n<p>A public mental health approach focuses on wider prevention of mental illness and promotes positive mental health across the life course. This supports Andrews G, et. al&#8217; s (2004), argument that as optimal treatment for mental disorders will only avert 28% of the burden of mental illness, the need for prevention cannot be over-emphasized.</p>\n<p>Prevention and promotion interventions are relevant at each life stage. Robust evidence exists for a wide range of interventions which prevent mental disorder, promote well-being and help strengthen resilience against adversity, ensuring a positive start in life and healthy adult and older years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>interventions to improve parental health</li>\n<li>pre-school and early education interventions</li>\n<li>school-based mental health promotion and mental illness prevention</li>\n<li>prevention of violence and abuse</li>\n<li>prevention of suicide</li>\n<li>early intervention for mental illness</li>\n<li>alcohol, smoking and substance abuse reduction and prevention</li>\n<li>promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours</li>\n<li>promoting healthy workplaces</li>\n<li>prevention of mental illness and promotion of well-being in older years</li>\n<li>housing interventions</li>\n<li>reduced stigma and discrimination</li>\n<li>positive mental health and recovery from mental illness</li>\n<li>ensuring that people&#8217;s access to psychological therapies is not hindered by their ethnicity, culture, faith or socio-economic status through targeted mental health promotion of and use of culturally-appropriate services.</li>\n<li>building strength, safety and resilience will address inequalities and ensure safety and security at individual, relationship, community and environmental levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a need to develop a sustainable, connected community in order to create a socially-inclusive Reading that promotes social networks and environmental engagement. More support should be provided to employers to promote workplace wellbeing. By helping staff to cope, employers can increase productivity and prevent the build-up of unmanageable stress at work (Department of Health, 2014).</p>\n<p>People of all ages with mental health problems should receive at least the equivalent level of access to timely, evidence-based, clinically effective, recovery focused, safe and personalised care as people with a physical health condition. The physical needs of people with mental health conditions need to be assessed routinely alongside their psychological needs and vice versa.</p>\n<h2>Links to other sections in the JSNA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/\">Children &amp; Adolescent Mental Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/offenders/\">Offenders</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/social-and-environmental-context/\">Social &amp; Environmental Context</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/suicide-and-self-harm/\">Suicide &amp; Self Harm</a></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>Abbott RA, Ploubidis GB, Croudace TJ, <em>et al</em>(2008) The relationship between early personality and midlife psychological well-being: Evidence from a UK birth cohort study. <em>Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology</em>, Epub 2008 Apr 28.

It includes a detailed schedule for care during pregnancy. This schedule requires that the mother receives the following checks in pregnancy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A full health and social care assessment of needs, risks and choices by 12 weeks of pregnancy by a midwife or maternity healthcare professional;</li>\n<li>Notification to the child health programme team of prospective parents requiring additional early intervention and prevention;</li>\n<li>Routine antenatal care and screening for maternal infections, rubella susceptibility, blood disorders and foetal anomalies;</li>\n<li>Health and lifestyle advice to include diet, weight control, physical activity, smoking, stress in pregnancy, alcohol, drug intake, etc.;</li>\n<li>Distribution of <a href=\"http://www.publichealth.hscni.net/publications/pregnancy-book-0\">The Pregnancy Book</a> to first-time parents; access to written/online information about, and preparation for, childbirth and parenting; distribution of antenatal screening leaflet;</li>\n<li>Discussion on benefits of breastfeeding with prospective parents, and risks of not breastfeeding;</li>\n<li>Introduction to resources, including children&#8217;s centres, Family Information Services, primary healthcare teams, and benefits and housing advice;</li>\n<li>Support for families whose first language is not English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, preparation for parenthood should begin early in pregnancy and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information on services and choices, maternal/paternal rights and benefits, use of prescription drugs during pregnancy, dietary considerations, travel safety, maternal self-care, etc.</li>\n<li>Social support using group-based antenatal classes in community or healthcare settings that respond to the priorities of parents and cover:\n<ul>\n<li>the transition to parenthood (particularly for first-time parents); relationship issues and preparation for new roles and responsibilities; the parent-infant relationship; problem-solving skills (based on programmes such as Preparation for Parenting, First Steps in Parenting, One Plus One);</li>\n<li>the specific concerns of fathers, including advice about supporting their partner during pregnancy and labour, care of infants, emotional and practical preparation for fatherhood (particularly for first-time fathers);</li>\n<li>discussion on breastfeeding using interactive group work and/or peer support programmes; and standard health promotion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, extra support should be offered to vulnerable women at risk of having low birth weight babies.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>During 2013/14 data submissions to NHS England recording the number of women accessing maternity services by 12 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy were insufficient to calculate an England total. In 2012/13 the percentage was 94.2%, an increase on the 2011/12 figure of 92.9%.</p>\n<p>There are six National Key Performance Indicators (KPI&#8217;s) for antenatal screening and a further 5 newborn screening KPIs. The latest data is for Q2 2014/15. Nationally 7 of the total 11 KPIs reached the &#8216;acceptable&#8217; target level. Those which didn&#8217;t were for Down&#8217;s Syndrome Screening (0.4% away from target), New Born Hearing Test within 4 weeks of referral (4.7% away from target), New Born Bloodspot Screening (2.2% away from target), and avoidable Bloodspot repeat tests (0.9% away from target). (<em>Note: Refer to Antenatal &amp; Newborn Screening section for local data</em>).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>During 2013/14, 90.2% of pregnant women from NHS North &amp; West Reading CCG were accessing maternity services by 12 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy. 89% of pregnant women from NHS South Reading CCG were accessing maternity services by 12 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy (<em>data met the validation criteria</em>).</p>\n<h2>Births</h2>\n<p>The number of births will always be higher than maternities, due to multiple births. The general fertility rate (GFR) is 67.8/1000 women aged 15-44. Number of live births in 2014 in Reading was 2572, a decrease of 50 from 2013. There was an overall reduction in the number of live births at RBH between 2011/12 (5963) and 2014/15 (5681).</p>\n<p>In 2014, 2.6% of births in Reading were home births, compared to 2.3% across England (<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthcharacteristicsinenglandandwales/2015-10-08\">ONS, 2015</a>). The fertility of women under twenty years of age has fallen by 10%, and indeed has been falling across Europe steadily for the last ten years. Fertility rates in the over 35s have, in contrast, risen but only by about 2.5%. Teenage conceptions have, historically been reported to be higher in this part of the Thames Valley than the National average, but the number who are still of statutory school age who actually continue with their pregnancy is small, typically around 10-12. In 2014 there were just four girls who became mothers. Locally, 265 young women under the age of 20 had babies in the last year, a fall of 10% on 2013, and nearly 30% fewer than in 2012.</p>\n<h2>Risk Factors for Complex Births</h2>\n<p>Factors that increase the complexity of maternity care include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age</strong> &#8211; In 2013, just over 900 women were over 35 years of age at booking at Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH). In 2010 there were 580 from Reading. They are at greater risk of complications and this impacts on the prenatal screening and diagnostic services, and is associated with an increased prevalence of comorbidities which impact on all aspects of antenatal and intrapartum care.</li>\n<li><strong>Obesity </strong>&#8211; If a pregnant woman is obese this will have a greater negative influence on their health and the health of their unborn baby. In 2011/12 18% of mothers booking were obese (Body Mass Index of over 30kg/m2), an increase from 15% in 2007 (source Berkshire West Maternity Needs assessment).</li>\n<li><strong>Smoking</strong> &#8211; Smoking Status at Time of Delivery (SATOD) is recorded and in 2014/15 7.4% of maternities in Reading had smoking recorded, which compares favourably to the England rate of 11.4%. Nationally, in 2013/14, 47% (n = 9,385) of pregnant women setting a quit date successfully quit.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethnicity and deprivation </strong>&#8211; Office of National Statistics (ONS) data shows that mothers with a Black or Asian background have higher rates of neonatal and infant deaths, and babies with African, Asian and Caribbean ethnicity also having higher rates of low birth weights.</li>\n<li><strong>Lon</strong><strong>g Term Conditions </strong>&#8211; The Royal Berkshire Hospital is reporting higher number of maternity cases with diabetes and heart disease (RBH is the only District General Hospital in Thames Valley to have a dedicated cardiac antenatal clinic: every other unit refers to a teaching centre) which leads to more complex maternity care</li>\n<li><strong>Caesarean section rates</strong> &#8211; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg132\">NICE, 2011</a>) have published guidelines for caesarean sections &#8211; and whilst there is not a defined optimal percentage the Royal Berkshire Hospital caesarean section rate is around 28% with national averages around 25%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table class=\"bluegeneral\" summary=\"Percentage of deliveries conducted by caesarean section at maternity units serving the Berkshire population - 2013/14\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluetopleft\" colspan=\"2\">Percentage  of  deliveries  conducted  by  caesarean  section  at  maternity  units serving the Berkshire population  &#8211; 2013/14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Royal Berkshire Hospital</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">28.0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Wexham Park</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\"><a href=\"http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/about-rcog-guidelines\">29.0%</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Great Western</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">26.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Frimley Park</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">24.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Basingstoke and North Hampshire</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">24.9%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>Quality and safety are essential in the delivery of maternity care to ensure we get the best outcomes for babies and mothers. There is a strong national framework for maternity services with significant national policy and guidance. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have <a href=\"https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/\">published clinical standards</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.nhsla.com/Safety/Documents/NHS%20LA%20Risk%20Management%20Standards%202013-14.pdf\">NHS Litigation Authority</a> has published standards for  risk  management  and  National  Institute  for  Health and  Clinical  Excellence (NICE) have published a wide range of <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\">clinical guidance and pathways</a> that should be followed to ensure the best care is available during and after pregnancy.</p>\n<p>National policies on maternity particularly emphasize the rights of mothers to choose not only location of birth but also the style of birth (within clinical indications).</p>\n<p>For mothers registered with South Reading CCG / North and West CCG most births occur in the Royal Berkshire Hospital. However, a small percentage does choose to have their babies at Basingstoke and Oxford hospitals.</p>\n<p>Mothers should be able to choose with clinical support the options of home births, midwife led births or consultant led births<strong>. </strong>All of these options are now available within the Royal Berkshire Hospitals; however as mentioned previously caesarean section rates are higher than the national average as are home births.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Locally there is a pressure on maternity capacity and the local commissioners are developing actions to ensure that the accessibility, quality and safety of the services are protected and developed in a cost effective way. Acting together the Berkshire West CCGs have developed a 2014/15 action plan that offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessible, safe, high quality, supportive maternity services which meet the needs of our local population and ensure the most effective use of NHS resources</li>\n<li>A women-led service that provides an excellent maternity experience for women and their partners</li>\n<li>Women-centred maternity services that provide choice, continuity and confidence for women, designed to meet their individual needs of and those of their babies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Antenatal clinics are offered by royal Berkshire Foundation NHS Trust across Berkshire. Whilst clinics are offered on three sites, access to a sonographer to scan whilst the mother is in clinic is limited to the Royal Berkshire Hospital site: at Wokingham there is neither machine nor personnel. Whilst obstetricians can scan, they are not all trained to the &#8216;intermediate level&#8217; and scanning will add up to twenty minutes to an appointment where a sonographer is not available, and so cannot be &#8216;slotted in&#8217; without impacting on other women&#8217;s appointments and waiting times once they arrive.</p>\n<p>Home births take two midwives into the home to deliver a healthy low risk mother of a healthy baby, at a time when the staff numbers make it harder to maintain safe levels in the hospital (on both the midwifery led birth centre (Rushey) and the main delivery suite).</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/antenatal-and-newborn-screening/\">Antenatal &amp; Newborn Screening</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/early-access-to-antenatal-care/\">Early access to antenatal care</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/birth-predictions/\">Birth predictions over coming years</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/infant-mortality/\">Infant Mortality</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Department of Health, 2009.

    "title": "Long term neurological conditions",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord and sensory receptors such as the eyes and ears. The nervous system works to regulate and co-ordinate the body&#8217;s activities. Neurological conditions occur when a person&#8217;s nervous system is damaged through illness or injury and this regulation and co-ordination will be affected as a result. Sometimes it is known how damage has occurred (e.g. as a result of head injury). In other instances the exact cause of the damage is not known and it is likely that the damage is a result of more than one factor.</p>\n<p>A long term neurological condition (LTNC) is one in which will affect a person and those who care for them for all of their life. For some, the condition will progress at a rate which can vary greatly between conditions and between individuals. For others their will be no progression of the condition though the person&#8217;s needs will change due to their own development or ageing. Some conditions such as epilepsy are intermittent meaning they will affect people differently at different times. LTNCs can occur at any point in a person&#8217;s life: they may be present from birth; they may develop in childhood or adulthood; or may be due to a sudden injury.</p>\n<p>People with a LTNC and their carers can be supported to manage the LTNC in a way which is best for them. This requires supporting peoples to live independently, often for many years. People with LTNCs can have a good quality of life and have the same capacity to excel as anyone else.</p>\n<p>The symptoms of LTNC are wide-ranging and vary both between and within conditions. This means that people with LTNC may require support from a wide range of services which will require co-ordination. Despite the very different journeys faced by people with differing LTNC, they all share feelings related to facing a future that will require adjustments to their lives and the lives of those who care for them.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<h3>Prevalence</h3>\n<p>LTNCs are more common than most people (including health professionals realise with 10 million people living with a LTNC in the UK. LTNCs account for 19% of hospital admissions (<a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/guidelines-policy/long-term-neurological-conditions\">Royal College of Physicians, 2008</a>). They are the third most common reason for seeing at GP (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198114/National_Service_Framework_for_Long_Term_Conditions.pdf\">Department of Health, 2005</a>).</p>\n<p>25% of people between the ages of 16 and 64 with a chronic disability have a neurological condition and 33% of disabled people in residential care have neurological condition (Royal College of Nursing et al, 2009).</p>\n<p>There are few robust estimates of the incidence and prevalence of LTNC in the UK. A systematic review was conducted in 2011 to address this (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21088431\">Hoppitt et al, 2011</a>).</p>\n<p>The following table shows the estimated incidence and prevalence of LTNC. Figures should be regarded as minimum figures as even if 100% of diagnosed patents were captured, there would still be omissions of those undiagnosed.</p>\n<p>Table 1: Estimated prevalence and incidence of LTNC</p>\n<p>Prevalence = the total number of people with a disease or condition in the population at any one time</p>\n<p>Incidence = the number of new cases of a disease or condition during a year</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Estimated prevalence and incidence of LTNC\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>LTNC</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Populations at risk</th>\n<th>Measure</th>\n<th>Rate</th>\n<th>Source</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Motor Neurone Disease</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">A rare neurodegenerative conditions leading to progressive muscle weakness causing loss or mobility and difficulties with speech, swallowing, and breathing</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Affects adults of all ages though usually diagnosed in people over 40.

They can also greatly affect the lives of those who care for the person with a LTNC.</p>\n<h3>Services</h3>\n<p>People with LTNC have improved health outcomes when they obtain a prompt diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment quickly <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198114/National_Service_Framework_for_Long_Term_Conditions.pdf\">(Department of Health, 2005</a>). There is a lack of rehabilitation service provisions for people with LTNCs (<a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/guidelines-policy/long-term-neurological-conditions\">Royal College of Physicians, 2008</a>).</p>\n<p>There is some evidence that people from minority ethnic backgrounds find it more difficult to access neurological services <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198114/National_Service_Framework_for_Long_Term_Conditions.pdf\">(Department of Health, 2005</a>).</p>\n<p>63% of people responding to a survey about peoples with LTNCs experience of hospital admissions (NCPC, MNDA, MSS, and Parkinson&#8217;s UK 2009) were not asked if they had a care plan or advance decisions to refuse treatment. 25% felt that they were rarely listened to by staff during their admission. 13.2% were readmitted within 4 weeks with a problem which related to their original admissions.</p>\n<p>A relatively small proportion of people with LTNC requiring palliative care services are accessing them. People with a cancer diagnosis are more likely to access palliative care across all settings when compared to people with a non-cancer diagnosis. Neurological conditions including motor neurone disease account for 23.7% of people seen in an inpatient setting; 31.9% seen in a day care setting; 17.4% seen in a community care setting; 8.8% of people seen in a hospital support setting; and 11% of people seen in an outpatient setting (<a href=\"http://www.ncpc.org.uk/MDS-2013-14-Summary\">National Council for Palliative care, 2015</a>). There is unequal access to palliative care services on a basis of ethnicity with non-white people having below expected levels of access across all settings (<a href=\"http://www.ncpc.org.uk/MDS-2013-14-Summary\">National Council for Palliative care, 2015</a>).</p>\n<p>Systems used to collect information on people accessing palliative care vary with some services having no clinical database at all and data quality issues remain some cause for concern despite recent prioritisation od data collection (<a href=\"http://www.ncpc.org.uk/MDS-2013-14-Summary\">National Council for Palliative care, 2015</a>).</p>\n<h2>Facts, figures, and trends</h2>\n<p>There is no one source of data which will allow us to see the number of people living with LTNCs in the local area. Two key sources of information which we can use as a best guide are nationally researched prevalence rates such as those in table 1 above; and the number of admissions which mention specific LTNC diagnoses. The latter of which can also be used as a measure of how well LTNCs are being treated in primary care. Some LTNC are also counted on GP registers and we can also look to the number of people who are accessing specific services as a further guide. The data below is provided on a profile created by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england\">Public Health England</a> which can be accessed here for further information about the provide of LTNC in the area.</p>\n<p>Data is presented at the level of Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG): for Reading, this is South Reading and North and West Reading CCGs. Some data is shown for all LTNCs and others for specific diagnoses.</p>\n<h2>All LTNCs</h2>\n<p>The first chart below shows us the age standardised rate of emergency admissions to hospital due to a neurological condition with a mention of any of the neurological conditions in the diagnosis code, for those aged 20+ (CCG resident population). It can be seen that admission rates for people registered with the local CCGs are lower than the national average with this difference much more pronounced in North and West Reading. This is telling us that either the prevalence of these conditions (or the rate in which they are recorded) is lower in the local area or that the conditions are better managed in local primary care preventing the need for hospital admission.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5337/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5338/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England</p>\n<p>When we look at the age standardised rate of new outpatient appointments (consultant led) for those aged 20+ in the local area we can see that these rates are above the national average particularly in South Reading. Patients are more likely than the England average to be seen close to their home for outpatient appointments.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5339/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England</p>\n<h2>Epilepsy</h2>\n<p>Around 590 people aged 18 and over who are registered with each CCG are recorded as having a diagnosis of epilepsy. This is a rate of an average of approx. 600 people per 100,000 which is lower than the England average of 780 people per 100,000. The rate is lower in South Reading than North and West Reading. This does not necessarily mean that the prevalence is truly lower as people&#8217;s diagnosis may not be recorded on the GP Practice system. However, significantly fewer people from the CCGs are admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of epilepsy which could support a lower prevalence or could indicate that epilepsy is better managed in primary care within the CCG. Increased evidence for the good management of epilepsy in primary care comes from a higher rate of people with diagnosed epilepsy from the CCGs being seizure free for a 12 month period than the England average. The rate of mortality from and underlying cause of epilepsy in the local area is comparable to the England average.</p>\n<h2>Headaches and migraine</h2>\n<p>It is not possible to put a figure on the number of people who suffer from severe headache or migraine in the local area but we can look at the number of hospital admissions where headache or migraine is mentioned as either the primary or a secondary reason for admission. Around 250 people from the CCGs are admitted to hospital as an emergency for this reason each year. This is a rate of around 160 per 100,000 which is a lower rate than the national average.</p>\n<h2>Motor neurone disease</h2>\n<p>Around 20 people from the CCGs are admitted to hospital as an emergency admission each year &#8211; a rate of around 15 per 100,000. Numbers are too small to say that this is higher or lower than the England average.</p>\n<h2>Multiple sclerosis</h2>\n<p>Around 66 people from the CCGs are admitted to hospital each year. Admissions are lower than the England average.</p>\n<h2>Parkinson&#8217;s disease</h2>\n<p>Around 190 people from the CCGs are admitted to hospital each year. The rate of admission is comparable to the England average.</p>\n<h2>Brain and spinal injury</h2>\n<p>The chart below shows us the age standardised rate of emergency admissions with a mention of Traumatic Brain and Spine Injury in the diagnosis code, this is for those aged 20+. Rates are not calculated when the number of admissions is less than 20. Around 40 per 100,000 people from the local area are admitted for this reason each year.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5340/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5341/image5/image/image5.png\" alt=\"image5 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>The National Service Framework for Long-term Conditions (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198114/National_Service_Framework_for_Long_Term_Conditions.pdf\">The Department of Health, 2005</a>).

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>A long-term condition is defined as one for which there is no cure but which can be controlled by medication and/or other treatments and/or therapies. They therefore require ongoing management over a period of years. About one in seven young people (15%) aged 11-15 in the UK report having been diagnosed with a long term medical condition.</p>\n<p>Common long-term conditions in childhood include: Diabetes, Asthma, Epilepsy, Eczema, Severe allergies/anaphylaxis, cancer, physical or mental impairment. This section will focuses principally on, &#8220;insulin-dependent diabetes, asthma and epilepsy&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>Diabetes</h2>\n<p>Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), commonly referred to as type-I diabetes, is a condition caused when an autoimmune response induces the death of insulin-secreting b-cells in the pancreas.  When b-cells are destroyed, the body becomes incapable of producing insulin; therefore, glucose levels in the blood are unable to be controlled, leading to hyperglycaemia, or high blood glucose level.  Long-term complications of hyperglycaemia include cardiovascular, kidney, and eye diseases, as well as various nervous system disorders.</p>\n<h2>Asthma</h2>\n<p>Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways, causing recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing, with the coughing often occurring at night or early in the morning.</p>\n<p>This narrowing or inflammation is caused when certain natural chemicals within the body are released, usually in response to infection or when the patient comes into contact with an asthma trigger.</p>\n<p>Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Treatment generally works well to ease and prevent symptoms, usually with inhalers. A typical person with asthma may take a preventer inhaler every day (to prevent symptoms developing), and use a reliever inhaler as and when required (if symptoms flare up).</p>\n<h2>Epilepsy</h2>\n<p>Epilepsy is the tendency to have recurring seizures that start in the brain. The brain uses electrical signals to pass messages between brain cells. If these signals are disrupted, this can lead to a seizure. The fact that seizures can reoccur is key, as a one off seizure does not mean it is epilepsy.</p>\n<p>Getting a diagnosis of epilepsy can often take some time. Only until there have been two or more seizures that a diagnosis of epilepsy will be considered, unless there is an obvious known cause. There is no test for epilepsy and diagnosis is almost entirely dependent on medical history, although this can be possible with an accurate eye witness account. Usually an initial medical examination will take place and the results of any further investigations will also take into account eyewitnesses reports.</p>\n<h2>Facts, figures and Trends</h2>\n<p>There has been little change in the rate of emergency admissions for asthma, diabetes and epilepsy in under 19s in Reading since 2011/2012. Although there has been greater fluctuation in the national rate, the two rates have remained similar in that time.</p>\n<p>Figure 1. Emergency hospital admissions for asthma, diabetes and epilepsy in under 19s 2003/4 &#8211; 2014/15 in Reading</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6824/Figure-1/image/Figure_1Emergency_Hospital_Admissions.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: NHS Digital Indicator Portal</p>\n<p>By applying estimates of rates of national prevalence to local population estimates, it is possible to make a prediction of the number of children and young people in the local area who are likely to have each condition. This calculation does not take account of factors associated with socio-economic conditions that may have an impact on prevalence (such as the effect of prevalence of smoking on asthma diagnoses, for example, or the prevalence of obesity in children for Type 2 diabetes). Using these estimates, Reading is likely to have around:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2966 children under the age of 16 with asthma,</li>\n<li>between 71 and 88 children under the age of 19 with diabetes, and</li>\n<li>136 children under the age of 16 with epilepsy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the NHS Outcome Framework Indicators measures potentially avoidable emergency hospital admission for asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy in under-19 year olds. During 2014/15, 55 children from North &amp; West Reading CCG and 91 children from South Reading CCG were admitted for these conditions (figure 2). The rate in South Reading CCG is very similar to the national average, while the number in North and West Reading CCG is lower.</p>\n<p>Figure 2. Avoidable emergency hospital admissions for asthma, diabetes and epilepsy in under-19s 2013/2014 in Berkshire CCGs</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6825/Figure-2/image/Figure_2Avoidable_emergency_hospital_admissions.png\" alt=\"Figure 2 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Health and Social Care Information Centre indicator portal, 2015.</p>\n<p><em>Asthma</em></p>\n<p>Asthma is the most common long-term health condition.1.1 million children (one in 11) in the UK have been diagnosed with asthma and are currently receiving treatment and a child in the UK is admitted to hospital every 20 minutes because of an asthma attack (<a href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/facts-and-statistics/\">Asthma UK</a>). In 2014/15 there were 23,433 emergency admissions of children aged under 16 with asthma to hospitals in the UK, a rate of 222.74 per 100,000. The rate for Reading was slightly lower at 190.51 per 100,000 (66 admissions), although the difference is too small to be considered statistically robust (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2016).</p>\n<p><em>Diabetes</em></p>\n<p>There are an estimated 31,500 children and young people under the age of 19 with diabetes in the UK, of whom around 95.1% have Type 1. A 2009 survey by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health found a slightly higher of boys were diagnosed than girls (51.1% were male) and the greatest number of children diagnosed with diabetes were aged 10-14 years. (77% of all children with Type 1 diabetes were in this age group and 98% of those with Type 2). The peak age for diagnosis for Type 1 diabetes is between 9 and 14 years of age (Diabetes UK, 2015; Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, 2009).</p>\n<p><em>Epilepsy</em></p>\n<p>The total number of children under 5 years old with epilepsy is approximately one in 509, increasing to one in 240 for all children aged under 16 years, and one in 220 for those aged under 18 years (<a href=\"http://www.youngepilepsy.org.uk/about-epilepsy/what-is-epilepsy/\">Young Epilepsy</a>).</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>In the statutory guidance <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484418/supporting-pupils-at-school-with-medical-conditions.pdf\">Supporting pupils at school with medical conditions</a>, the  Department for Education sets out guidance for schools, Local Authorities, CCGs, NHS bodies, pupils, parents and carers on how to provide the best support to pupils with long term health conditions.</p>\n<h2>What are the key Inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Most individual long term conditions in the whole population (including adults) are more common in people from lower socio-economic groups (Kings Fund) and several studies have argued that there appears to be a socio-economic gradient in the prevalence of long term conditions in childhood.</p>\n<p>Access to appropriate health care and support for children with long term conditions can help to ensure that they are able to manage their condition well, reducing ill health and any further deterioration or secondary conditions, that their health does not impact on their school attendance or any other aspect of their education, and that they are able to take advantages of the same opportunities as their peers.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Most individual long term conditions in the whole population (including adults) are more common in people from lower socio-economic groups (Kings Fund) and several studies have argued that there appears to be a socio-economic gradient in the prevalence of long term conditions in childhood.</p>\n<p>Access to appropriate health care and support for children with long term conditions can help to ensure that they are able to manage their condition well, reducing ill health and any further deterioration or secondary conditions, that their health does not impact on their school attendance or any other aspect of their education, and that they are able to take advantages of the same opportunities as their peers.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>There are likely to be at least 3,000 children in Reading who have been diagnosed with a long term condition and there were around 135 emergency admissions to hospital of children with long term conditions in Reading during 2015 (based on a rate of 329 per 100,000 and a population of around 41,000). Prevalence and rates of hospital admission are largely similar to the national average, although rates of admissions in the North and West Reading CCG area are lower than the average. Most of these are accounted for by asthma.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>According to Diabetes UK, only six per cent of children and young people, whose checks are being recorded, are getting all of the recommended diabetes care, services and support they are entitled to. It is therefore not surprising that over 85 per cent of children and young people over the age of 12 have blood glucose levels higher than the recommended targets. Furthermore, only 16 per cent of children and young people with diabetes in England and Wales achieve targets in relation to controlling their condition, putting them at increased risk of developing diabetes-related complications later in life.</p>\n<p>Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines for the management of paediatric and adult asthma, there remains a significant gap between accepted best practices for asthma care and actual care delivered to asthma patients. Paediatric asthma is still one of the major reasons for attendance at Accident and Emergency.</p>\n<p>Outcomes for children and young people with epilepsy are far from ideal. The systemic issues identified decades ago remain problems today. Epilepsy care for children and young people continues to be inadequate, relative to clear consensus and national guidelines.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/diabetes/\">Diabetes</a></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>Asthma UK. <em>Asthma Fact and Statistics</em>.

    "title": "Loneliness and social isolation in Reading",
    "content": "<h2>Common themes</h2>\n<h3>Age</h3>\n<p>Although loneliness and social isolation are important issues for people in older age groups, local and national survey results indicate that other age groups are also affected. As well as those of older age,those of older working age and young adults may also be at risk.</p>\n<p>Most older people in Reading live in neighbourhoods in the North and West of the Borough (Peppard, Thames, Mapledurham, Kentwood, Tilehurst and Southcote) . Higher numbers of those in older working age groups also live in these areas, as well as neighbourhoods around Whitley and Park wards in the South. Young adults are more likely to live in more central areas, including those adjacent to the University of Reading.</p>\n<h3>Living alone</h3>\n<p>Positive relationships with family, especially with a spouse or life partner, are protective against loneliness. Local and national survey results suggest that those living alone were more likely to report loneliness.</p>\n<p>Most people living alone in Reading live in in areas around the town centre, including adjacent to the University of Reading. About three quarters of these reported being single and never married. The largest numbers who reported their status as separated or divorced lived in Abbey, Whitley and Norcot wards and the largest numbers of widowed people lived in Tilehurst, Peppard and Southcote.</p>\n<h3>Life events</h3>\n<p>Key transitions in people&#8217;s lives appear to increase the risk of both loneliness and social isolation. This could include changes in relationships, changes in health status, or a change that affects the person&#8217;s role or sense of identity such as retirement, bereavement or becoming a parent. There is some evidence that for many people this may be a transitory phase after which they are able to enlarge or improve the quality of their network of relationships and &#8216;recover&#8217; from loneliness in due course.</p>\n<p>Although these experiences are difficult to quantify locally, it is notable that Reading&#8217;s 2017 survey of residents found that those who had lived in the area for a relatively short amount of time appeared more vulnerable to loneliness than those who had been resident for longer. Reading has a relatively young and transient population, including a substantial student population and high rate of international immigration. While moving to Reading should not be the only life event considered, this may be an event likely to be experienced by the local population.</p>\n<p>Some commentators make the point that those in older age may be more likely to have been affected by significant life events, especially bereavement.</p>\n<h3>Income</h3>\n<p>Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) suggests that wealth is the factor with the strongest correlation with loneliness. Reviews discuss both practical constraints resulting from lack of income and wider social exclusion associated with deprivation and lack of social resources and support.</p>\n<p>Reading has key areas of high deprivation found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the far south of Whitley ward and Northumberland Avenue area</li>\n<li>throughout Abbey ward and around the town centre</li>\n<li>around Dee Road in Norcot ward</li>\n<li>around Coronation Square in Southcote ward; and</li>\n<li>around Amersham Road in Caversham ward</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Transport</h3>\n<p>Lack of affordable transport and access to local facilities were highlighted as potential barriers to social connectedness and to maintaining relationships with others, but researchers found it difficult to assess impact. As people who are more inclined towards social participation may be more likely to live near a busy community or a regular bus route than those who are not, it was impossible to determine whether higher levels of social participation were the result of the bus route or of personal preference.</p>\n<p>Deprivation related to geographical barriers (access to shops, post office, GP surgery and primary school) in Reading appears to mainly affect areas in the North and West of the Borough, as well as some areas around Coley and Whitley.</p>\n<h3>Health</h3>\n<p>While there is agreement that poor health contributes to the risk of loneliness and social isolation, it is more difficult to determine how the two are connected. Age UK warn against the assumption that those with health conditions necessarily have less social interaction than others and suggest that health conditions may combine with other factors to make social interaction more difficult. Some research participants spoke about management of health issues leaving them feeling drained of energy, or of feeling like a burden or inconvenience to other people.  More work may be useful to understand how different health conditions may affect loneliness and social isolation differently.</p>\n<p>In Reading, residents in the North of the Borough and around Kentwood and Tilehurst were more likely to report being in &#8216;very bad health&#8217;, while those in the South and West of Reading were the most likely to report &#8216;bad health&#8217;. The indices of multiple deprivation for health deprivation and disability suggest worst health in the South of the Borough, particularly in most deprived neighbourhoods.</p>\n<h2>What works?</h2>\n<p>Working with communities to promote strong social networks and connection with community.</p>\n<p>Interventions to help people understand how to maintain and extend their social network, usually in groups but also one-to-one.</p>\n<p>Importantly, identifying existing services and their impact on social connectivity and  prevention and reduction of loneliness.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Becoming lonely or socially isolated is a complex process affected by a range of interrelated factors. Individuals may be at greater risk if they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are single (have no current spouse of life partner)</li>\n<li>have recently experienced a significant change to their life</li>\n<li>are impeded by practical barriers (a health problem, transport, lack of time or energy)</li>\n<li>lack economic or social resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Older people or older working age people may be more likely to meet these criteria, as they are more likely to have experienced bereavement or divorce, and local survey results indicate that a recent move to the area (meeting the criteria for a significant change) may be a particular risk in Reading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Loneliness-and-Social-Isolation-in-Reading.pdf\">Loneliness and Social Isolation in Reading</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Liver disease",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Liver disease is caused by a wide range of pathological processes. These can be congenital diseases such as hereditary metabolic and autoimmune conditions, or long standing and preventable lifestyle choices. The latter contributes to the vast majority (95%) of cases.</p>\n<p>Preventable causes of liver disease include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chronic excessive consumption of alcohol, which can cause alcoholic liver disease;</li>\n<li>chronic maintenance of an obese body habitus, which can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;</li>\n<li>contraction and subsequent chronic infection from hepatitis B or C, which can cause viral hepatitis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chronic liver disease can also lead to liver cirrhosis, where the liver is damaged by a scaring process, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a primary cancer of liver cells. Cirrhosis of the liver can have serious health consequences including portal hypertension (increased pressure in a vein which supplies the liver with blood). This can lead to dangerous fluid build-up around the body. Additionally, portal hypertension can lead to life threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. Hepatocellular carcinoma is an uncommon cancer in the UK; however the above conditions increase ones chance of developing this condition.</p>\n<p>Liver disease, in contrast to other chronic diseases such as stroke, heart disease and many cancers, is increasing in its incidence and prevalence. The associated morbidity and mortality of liver disease is creating significant demands not only on the health care system, but also society as a whole. Liver disease is the only major cause of premature mortality which is increasing in England while this has been decreasing in the EU15 (the 15 European Union member-states between 1st January 1995 and 30th April 2004).</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<h2>Alcohol</h2>\n<p>The national cost of alcohol consumption can be measured financially, but there is also a cost to society in terms of crime, lost productivity, and morbidity and mortality. The financial cost of treating alcohol-related conditions is 3% of the NHS annual budget (<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmhealth/132/132.pdf\">Government&#8217;s Alcohol Strategy. Third Report of Session 2012-2013</a>). 70% of the cost to the NHS of alcohol-related services is spent on hospital treatment, largely for chronic conditions related to alcohol consumption. Restructuring this service to favour preventative measures represents an opportunity to achieve better outcomes for both individual patients and society. The estimated cost to society is £21 billion annually &#8211; £3.5 billion for NHS England; £11 billion for crime in England and £7.3 billion for lost productivity (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/lgb6/chapter/introduction\">National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence, Local Government Briefing 6)</a></p>\n<p>Data provided by the <a href=\"http://www.hscic.gov.uk/catalogue/PUB15483\">Health and Social Care Information Centre</a> (2014) describes the nation&#8217;s current consumption of alcohol trends. Most pertinently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Between 2005 and 2012 the proportion of men and women who drank alcohol in the week before being interviewed fell from 72% to 64% and 57% to 52% respectively.</li>\n<li>Among adults who had drunk alcohol in the last week, 55% of men and 53% of women drank more than the recommended daily amounts, according to previous guidance of no more than 4 units per day form men and three for women. New guidance as of 2016 does not recommend a daily limit, but now suggests a maximum recommended weekly limit of 14 units.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although the first statement suggests that alcohol consumption is falling, those who were drinking were doing so to excessive levels. With the re-classification of alcohol limits in 2016, we may see a sharp rise in apparently excessive alcohol consumption. Reading Borough Council carried out a extensive Drug and Alcohol Needs Assessment in 2015/16, please see this chapter for more information on the impact of alcohol on the Reading population.</p>\n<h2>Obesity:</h2>\n<p>The cost of being overweight and obese to society was estimated at £16billion in 2007 and this has been predicted to increase according to the department of health, possibly to £50 billion by 2050 if current trends continue (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189/chapter/introduction\">National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence</a>, 2014)</p>\n<h2>Hepatitis:</h2>\n<p>Greater optimism exists with regards to chronic viral hepatitis, as both vaccination and drug therapy continue to advance. Whilst initially expensive, new hepatitis C drugs represent long term cost-effective prevention of chronic liver disease. However, a barrier to this potential success is the underutilisation of the hepatitis B vaccination and the forecast increase in immigration of infected individuals from high prevalence countries, both causing pools of infection within the population.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>The health of the UK has been improving steadily for most diseases over recent decades. This is partly due to investment in resources to tackle diseases such as cardiac disease. Liver disease has not followed this trend and has in fact significantly increased in its prevalence. <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/crisis-of-liver-disease-in-the-uk\">The Lancet Commission</a> (2014) identifies that standard mortality rates have increased 400% from 1970 to 2010, and most of these patients die in working age (Figure 1). The <a href=\"https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/29/liver-disease-a-preventable-killer-of-young-adults/\">Office of National Statistics</a> identifies liver disease as the third largest cause of premature mortality after ischaemic heart disease and self harm.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Demonstrating percentage change in standardised mortality rates where 1970 is regarded as 100%</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5015/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/crisis-of-liver-disease-in-the-uk\">The Lancet Commission</a> (2014)</p>\n<p>In England, liver disease causes approximately 2% of all deaths and the total number is rising, from 15.8 per 100,000 in 2001-03 to 17.8 per 100,000 in 2012-14.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol:</h2>\n<p>In 2012/13, an estimated 1 million hospital admissions in England were for an alcohol related disease or injury as the primary reason for admission or a secondary diagnosis. There were 15,785 deaths specifically resulting from alcohol from 2010-2012.</p>\n<p>In 2012/13, there were 305,048 recorded crimes in England related to alcohol and 881,000 violent incidents in England and Wales where the victim believed the perpetrator was under the influence of alcohol (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs83\">National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence</a>, 2015).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/sites/files/nuffield/publication/alcohol-specific-activity_final-web.pdf\">Nuffield Trust</a> (2015) highlights that attendances to accident and emergency departments in England due to alcohol poisoning doubled from 2008/09 to 2013/14. Over a longer time period (2005/06 to 2013/14), alcohol-specific inpatient admissions increased by 64%, with emergency admissions increasing by 53% and elective admissions increasing by 143%.</p>\n<h2>Obesity:</h2>\n<p>Obesity rates in the UK almost doubled between 1993 and 2011, from 13% to 24% in men and 16% to 26% in women (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189/chapter/introduction\">National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence</a>, 2014). Obesity is directly linked to multiple chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, gallstones and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.</p>\n<h2>Hepatitis:</h2>\n<p>In 2014, a total of 488 acute or probable acute cases of hepatitis B were reported for England. This is an annual incidence of 0.91 per 100,000 population, higher than the incidence of 0.77 per 100,000 reported for 2013. 95% of new chronic hepatitis B infections seen in the UK occur in migrant populations following vertical transmission in the country of birth. 90% of those with chronic hepatitis C infections inject drugs or have done so in the past (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph43\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a>, 2012).</p>\n<p>Hepatitis C is primarily acquired through injecting drugs with shared needles. 70% of those with acute infection will develop chronic hepatitis. National estimates suggest that around 214,000 individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis C.</p>\n<h2>Reading&#8217;s Liver disease profile</h2>\n<p>In Reading, between 2001-03 and 2010-12, the average number of people who died each year with an underlying cause of liver disease increased from 27 to 30. The under 75 mortality rate from liver disease, 23.1 per 100,000 population, was significantly worse in Reading compared to England at 17.8 per 100,000 population. However, this was similar to the comparator group of local authorities from the same deprivation decile (Figure 2). Under 75 mortality rates for men were higher in Reading at 33.0 per 100,000 population and this was significantly worse than both the England, 23.4 per 100,000 population and the comparator group. Rates for women are not published for Reading, due to the low numbers.</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Under 75 mortality rate for liver disease (persons) in Reading</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5016/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> (2015)</p>\n<p>In 2013/14 there were 120 hospital admissions due to liver disease, a rate of 94.3 per 100,000 compared to the rate for England of 115.8 per 100,000.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol</h2>\n<p>There were 350 alcohol specific hospital admissions in Reading in 2013/14 (235 male and 115 female). The rate of alcohol specific hospital admissions in Reading is significantly lower than the England average. Between 2010 and 2012, an average of 10 men and 4 women aged under 75 died each year in Reading from alcoholic liver disease (<a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a>, 2015)</p>\n<p>Between 2006 and 2015 in Reading, alcoholic liver disease was the greatest cause of death in those dying from liver disease aged under 69 years. This is shown in Figure 3.</p>\n<p>Figure 3: Deaths from lived disease in Reading by age group (2006-2015)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5017/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Primary Care Mortality Database (2015)</p>\n<h2>Obesity</h2>\n<p>The proportion of Year 6 children classified as overweight or obese in Reading was 35% in 2014/15, which is similar to the England average of 33%. The proportion of adults classified as overweight or obese in 2012-14 was 61%, which was significantly better than the England average of 65% (<a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a>, 2015).</p>\n<h2>Hepatitis</h2>\n<p>In 2014, there were 22 new diagnoses of hepatitis C in Reading and 275 cases already diagnosed. In 2012/13, 85% of people injecting drugs, who were in their latest treatment episode at specialist drug services, took up the hepatitis C test they were offered. In 2012, it was estimated that 57% of those who inject drugs have been infected with hepatitis C. The estimated total infected with hepatitis C in Reading is 665 (<a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a>, 2015).</p>\n<p>In 2012/13, 82% of babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B received a complete course of hepatitis B vaccination. In the same year, the proportion of people in their latest treatment journey at specialist drug services, being offered and completing a course of hepatitis B vaccine was 25% (<a href=\"http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/liver-disease\">Public Health England</a>, 2015)</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>There is no national strategy on combating the rising level of liver disease however a local Drug and Alcohol Strategy will be published in early 2016 and this will address some of the local issues which contributes to this. Specific advice on liver disease can be found in Public Health England&#8217;s (2015) &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liver-disease-in-the-south-west-a-health-needs-assessment\">Liver Disease in the South West: a health needs assessment</a>&#8216;, and while this is based on South West England the recommendations can be generalised nationally. These include prevention strategies for the three main preventable causes of liver disease, which include identification and brief advice for alcohol misuse, needle and syringe programmes, immunisation for hepatitis B prevention and healthy lifestyles to reduce obesity and its impact on health. These will be considered in the local Drug and Alcohol Strategy which is due to be published.  Additional advice includes education for health care professionals, specifically improving expertise in primary care, and public health campaigns. Finally this document recommends a minimum unit price for alcohol, which is also included in the All-Party Parliamentary Hepatology Group (2014) Inquiry into Improving Outcomes in Liver Disease.</p>\n<p>The All-Party Parliamentary Hepatology Group&#8217;s Inquiry outlines 20 recommendations which focus on prevention of liver disease and the provision of national guidance for a coordinated approach to combating liver disease. As well as the recommendation that the government implements a minimum unit price of alcohol to 50p, it also endorses universal hepatitis B vaccination, elimination of hepatitis C in 15 years and the promotion of obesity reduction programs in the context of liver disease. It also recommends that Liver Function Tests should become part of the health check for over 40&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>The British Society of Gastroenterology has outlined key recommendations regarding alcohol related disease. Chief among these are for multidisciplinary &#8216;alcohol care team&#8217; led by a consultant to be accessible to a typical district general hospital. Additional recommendations include the instigation of coordinated policies on detection and management of alcohol-use disorders in accident and emergency departments with access to brief interventions and appropriate services within 24 hours of diagnosis, 7 day alcohol specialist nurses and link workers, addiction psychiatrists with specific responsibility for screening for depression, the establishment of an outreach alcohol service, integrated alcohol treatment pathways and integrated modular training in alcohol and addiction for relevant members of staff. Further research targeting alcohol-use disorders is also called for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/crisis-of-liver-disease-in-the-uk\">The Lancet Commission</a> provide 10 recommendations, again these largely focus on the detection, screening and prevention of liver disease with the provision of a 7 day specialist alcohol unit in district general hospitals. Their other recommendations mirror those already mentioned above.</p>\n<p>National Institute for Health and Care Institute guidance includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph43\">PH43: Hepatitis B and C testing</a> (2012) &#8211; aims to ensure more people at increased risk of hepatitis B and C infection are tested.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189\">CG189: Obesity identification, assessment and management</a> (2014) &#8211; evidence-based advice on the care and treatment of obesity.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs83\">QS83: Alcohol &#8211; preventing harmful use in the community</a> (2015)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Mortality from liver disease is increasing in the UK, whilst mortality from other major diseases is decreasing. Disease of the liver is largely caused by preventable lifestyle behaviours, the three main causes being alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and viral hepatitis. Whilst these three factors are all significant contributors to liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption represents the most serious burden. Alcohol consumption continues to rise rapidly and following this trend closely is a rise in alcohol related accident and emergency attendances, alcohol related hospital admissions to hospital, alcohol related mortality and a rise in alcohol related crime and loss of productivity. This represents an opportunity for preventative measures to be implemented to stem the rise.</p>\n<p>Although there is no national framework to combat liver disease, Public Health England recognises it as a public health priority and recommendations are being made by a variety of interested organisations aimed at tackling liver disease. A preventative approach will alleviate an increasing pressure on primary and secondary care providers.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Liver disease disproportionately affects the younger age groups &#8211; 90% of people who die from liver disease are under 70 years old and 10% of deaths of people in their 40&#8217;s are from liver disease (<a href=\"https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/29/liver-disease-a-preventable-killer-of-young-adults/\">Public Health England</a>, 2014).</p>\n<p>Alcoholic liver disease accounts for 37% of liver disease deaths and there are three times as many deaths from alcoholic liver disease in the most deprived areas of England compared to the least deprived. Mortality rates from liver disease for people aged 75 and under also vary significantly by geographical location, being generally higher in the north than the south of England. Part of this variation may be explained by underlying deprivation-related variation in liver disease incidence and mortality. Reading is classified within the 5th least deprived decile in the country.</p>\n<p>Deaths from liver disease in males exceed those in females for all age groups, apart from those aged 80 and over. Reading&#8217;s under 75 mortality rate from liver disease was significantly worse than the England average for men. Figures for women were not published, due to small numbers.</p>\n<p>Nationally, hospital admission rates due to liver disease are also higher for men at 145.9 per 100,000, compared to 87.6 per 100,000 for women. Hospital admission rates for alcoholic liver disease also reflect this difference with 44.0 admissions per 100,000 for men, compared to 20.3 per 100,000 for women.</p>\n<p>Over 70% of those dying with liver disease do so in hospital.</p>\n<h2>See also:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity &#8211; adult &amp; child</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/drugs-and-alcohol/\">Drugs &amp; Alcohol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/communicable-diseases/\">Communicable Diseases</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Life expectancy is considered to be the ultimate measure of the health and wellbeing in an area and a tool for identifying health inequality. To this end it is the overarching outcome of the <a title=\"DH\" href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_132358\">Department of Health Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> (PHOF)</p>\n<p>This indicator gives context to healthy life expectancy figures by providing information on the estimated length of life. The two indicators are extremely important summary measures of mortality and morbidity. They complement other PHOF indicators by showing the overall trends in major population health measures, setting the context in which local authorities and partners can assess the other indicators and identify the drivers of life expectancy and healthy life expectancy.</p>\n<p>The indicator measures the average number of years a person would expect to live based on contemporary mortality rates. For a particular area and time period, it is an estimate of the average number of years at age 65 a person would survive if he or she experienced the age-specific mortality rates for that area and time period throughout his or her life after that age.</p>\n<p>Figures are calculated from deaths from all causes and mid-year population estimates, based on data aggregated over a three year period. Figures reflect mortality among those living in an area in each time period, rather than what will be experienced throughout life among those born in the area. The figures are not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area could actually expect to live, both because the mortality rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Nationally there were 1.1% fewer deaths registered in England and Wales in 2014 compared to 2013. Age standardised morality rates continue to fall and have fallen by 20% for males and 17% for females since 2004.</p>\n<p>Cancers were the cause of the majority of deaths (29%).

There is a considerable and significant difference in life expectancy between people living in the richest and poorest neighbourhoods nationally as well as locally, and an even greater difference in disability free life expectancy. Thus, people in more deprived areas not only die sooner, but can expect to live more of their shorter lives with disability.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>As well as providing for the most basic needs of those with learning disabilities, national and local policy requires that local provision helps people to be independent, self-producing and socially connected.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Reading Borough Council (RBC) published &#8216;Reading Borough Council Strategy for People with Learning Disabilities&#8217; outlining the key priorities for the delivery of support for Learning Disabled people in Reading and incorporating the priorities expressed by the Learning Disability Partnership Board, the Corporate Plan and the Adult Social Care Strategy. The strategy was informed by a needs analysis which also forms the basis for this summary.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>A learning disability comprises reduced intellectual ability with the need for significant assistance with day-to-day living, (known as &#8216;social and adaptive functioning&#8217;). These needs will differ between individuals but can include the need for help with eating and drinking or keeping clean and warm; or with coming up with a way of resolving &#8216;real-life&#8217; problems like shortage of money, emotional or health problems, disagreement with other people or a wider social problem like litter (Mencap, 2015; British Psychological Society (BPS), 2000). The term &#8216;learning difficulty&#8217; is sometimes used interchangeably, but can also include those with dyslexia, dyspraxia or attention deficit disorder (ADD) and does not necessarily denote reduced intellectual ability (British Dyslexia Association, 2016).</p>\n<p>A learning disability develops when brain development is affected in an unborn baby or following an illness (such as meningitis) or injury in early childhood. Certain conditions, such as cerebral palsy and Down&#8217;s syndrome, are commonly associated with learning disability and there is a high prevalence of learning disability amongst those with autism and those with epilepsy (NHS Choices, 2015). Some diagnostic tests for genetic conditions are carried out during pregnancy, but in many cases a diagnosis will be given after birth, usually as a result of a parent or a professional working with the child noticing that they are not developing in the same way as other children their age. In some cases, it may be difficult to receive a diagnosis or a diagnosis may never be given (Mencap, 2016; NHS Choices, 2016).</p>\n<p>Some individuals with a learning disability may demonstrate &#8216;challenging behaviour&#8217;. Challenging behaviour cannot be diagnosed, but is often the result of personal interaction with the environment and can include aggression, self-injury, withdrawal or disruptive or destructive behaviour. It may bring the person into contact with the criminal justice system. Challenging behaviour is most common in teenagers and people in their early 20s and occurs more frequently in particular settings (for instance, 5-15% of people with a learning disability demonstrate challenging behaviour in education, health and social care settings and 30-40% in hospital settings) (NICE, 2015a).</p>\n<p>Some research suggests that adults with learning disabilities may have difficulty meeting their healthcare needs (Balogh, Oullette-Kuntz, Bourne, Lunsky and Colantonio, 2008; Mencap, 2007), although local responses to questions about self-reported health suggest that the proportion of people with learning disabilities reporting poor health is similar to the general population (Reading Borough Council, 2016).</p>\n<h2>Prevalence</h2>\n<p>The Projection of Adults Needs and Service Information (PANSI) estimates that 590 people in Reading had a moderate or severe learning disability in 2015, with the largest proportions aged 25-34 and 35-44 (see figure 1). In the next 14 years, PANSI predicts increases in older age groups, (which may reflect the ageing of those in the current &#8216;peak&#8217; age groups), as well as a significant increase in the number aged 18-24. A predicted increase amongst those in the younger age group is supported by Reading Borough Council&#8217;s own forecast, based on data held by the Children and Young People&#8217;s Disability team, of an increase in the number of 18-20 year olds who are likely to be accessing Adult Social Care by 2020.</p>\n<p>Figure 1. Reading adult residents predicted to have moderate or severe learning disability</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5011/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Reading Borough Council Strategy for People with Learning Disabilities, Part 2 &#8211; Needs Analysis</p>\n<p>There is some evidence to suggest that there may be a higher prevalence of severe learning disability amongst those from Pakistani and other South Asian ethnic groups (Emerson et al, 2010; Mencap). Since Reading has a higher proportion of Pakistani and South Asian residents than the England average, this may have an impact on prevalence estimates in Reading.</p>\n<h2>Reach of Care and Support Services</h2>\n<p>While comparing PANSI estimates to the total number known to adult social care in Reading (441) suggests that 75% are receiving care, the numbers known to services in the 18-24 and 35-44 age groups are lower than expected. Conversely, the numbers in older age groups are much closer to the PANSI predictions. This clearly suggests that older individuals who are eligible for services are more likely to be known to adult social care, while those who are not currently eligible are not yet known (Reading Borough Council, 2016).</p>\n<p>Figure 2. Percentage of adults with learning disability as estimated by PANSI known to Adult Social Care in Reading.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5012/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Reading Borough Council Strategy for People with Learning Disabilities, Part 2 &#8211; Needs Analysis.</p>\n<h2>Performance against National Indicators</h2>\n<p>National Adult Social Care policy takes a capability and asset focused approach to helping those with social care needs to achieve fulfilling and active lives. To meet these criteria, care provision needs to go beyond providing for the most basic needs, and ensure that people are able to be independent, self-efficacious and socially connected. For those with learning disabilities, there is a particular focus on people being able to access employment and living in their own home (Department of Health, 2014)</p>\n<p>Performance data from the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF) suggests that a smaller proportion of people with learning disabilities were in employment in Reading than in England or amongst areas considered similar to Reading (5.4% in Reading compared to 6.0% in England and 7.7% in similar local authority areas) and a smaller proportion were in stable accommodation than in England or amongst areas similar to Reading (Figures 3 and 4).</p>\n<p>Figure 3. Percentage of adults with learning disabilities in employment in Reading</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5013/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Adult Social Care Outcome Framework</p>\n<p>Figure 4. Percentage of adults with learning disabilities in stable accommodation in Reading</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5014/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Adult Social Care Outcome Framework</p>\n<h2>What services are provided?</h2>\n<p>The most significant service provisions for learning disabled individuals in April 2015 were supported living, day services and residential care (Reading Borough Council, 2016).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>177 adults with learning disabilities were open to Supported Living services in April 2015. Supported living enables people with learning disabilities to live independently while receiving support with day-to-day living as they require. In April 2015, 34% of people with a learning disability receiving adult social care services in Reading were in receipt of a supported living service at a cost of £15-1900 per week. RBC notes that cost effectiveness is variable, with cost not always reflecting level of need. Some individuals may be offered a care package that dictates a minimum number of care hours and restricts choice of accommodation to a single provider, restricting both client choice and value for money.</li>\n<li>134 adults with learning disabilities were open today services, and a further 41 were in receipt of Direct Payments in April 2015. A range of grant-funded community day services are commissioned from external providers to support development of self-advocacy and empowerment, offering advice and information for emerging care needs and support to help people re-settle in their own homes. Some additional community services are paid for by social care service users through Direct Payments (personal budgets for social care), but take up of Direct Payments in Reading is low. In March 2015 only 9% of people with a learning disability were receiving a Direct Payment. For those who have taken up the facility, feedback from users suggests Direct Payments increase independence (especially avoiding entry into residential care), improves consistency of care provision, and helps people to plan their expenditure and the support they need. However, it was seen by most as complicated and restrictive of choice, and involved long waits (up to 12 weeks) for payments or care</li>\n<li>Provision. RBC also provides an in-house learning disability day service that currently provides services on an individual basis and in groups of varying sizes to some 68 service users, mainly with profound and complex needs. The size of the in-house service has reduced considerably in the last ten years, as RBC has worked with external providers to increase the range of competitively priced services on offer elsewhere. A number of older people with learning disabilities attend day services for older people.</li>\n<li>121 adults with learning disabilities were open to Residential Care services in April 2015. Reading has a lower proportion of learning disabled people living in residential homes than neighbouring boroughs, but pays a higher average weekly cost. The cost of residential services range from £620 to £3800 per week. The majority of learning disabled people in residential care are aged 45 or older, and more people aged 65 or older were open to residential care than Supported Living services. This may be related to wider care needs amongst older people. Alternatively, it may reflect relatively recent movement towards independence and community-living in recommendations for practice and care. The way in which care is understood to be most effective has developed since some older individuals&#8217; initial contact with social care, with increased emphasis on support to live in the community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Responses to the ASCOF Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey 2014-15 show that most learning disabled respondents in Reading felt that care and support services helped them to have a better quality of life (96% compared to 92% of adult social care users in England) and more control over their daily life (89% of learning disabled in Reading and all adult social care users in England) and helped them to feel safe (92% compared to 85% in England). They found it easier than other adult social care users to access information about support, services and benefits and (29% compared to 23% of all social care users in Reading and 26% of all England) and were less likely to &#8216;top-up&#8217; their care (17% compared to 37% of adult social care users in Reading and 36% in England).</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>National Adult Social Care policy takes a capability and asset focused approach to helping those with social care needs to achieve fulfilling and active lives. For those with learning disabilities, there is a particular focus on people being able to access to employment and living in their own home (Department of Health, 2014).</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s Strategy for People with Learning Disabilities sets out a vision for the local authority to:</p>\n<p>&#8220;maximise [people with learning disabilities&#8217;] opportunity for inclusion within the local community and support them to grow and develop as individuals&#8230;We will take a strengths based approach to our work, taking as a starting point what people can achieve now for themselves, what they can achieve with support and, where possible, what they could achieve independently in the future&#8221;</p>\n<p>NICE guidelines for preventing challenging behaviour amongst people with a learning disability recommends regular health assessments, assessment of the behaviour, engagement in personalised and meaningful activities and minimal use of any restrictive interventions and anti-psychotic medication (NICE, 2015b)</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>While social care services for adults with learning disabilities are popular and well-used, there are continuing challenges to ensure that individuals have choice and control over their care and are fully supported to enjoy a fulfilling and meaningful life. Meeting this need is likely to require changes to delivery of Direct Payments and improvements to the ways in which people with learning disabilities are supported to connect with their communities, gain and sustain employment, and live independently in their own homes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, pressure on service provision can be expected to increase. The number of younger people with learning disabilities becoming eligible for adult social care services is expected to increase in the next 5-10 years, while the current large cohort aged 25-44 will become older and are likely to have additional care needs.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Research suggests that people with learning disabilities may find it more difficult to access health services (Balogh et al, 2008). Some of the reasons behind these difficulties may be particularly challenging for more deprived households or where English is not first language. Furthermore, those with lower incomes have less recourse to privately funded care services and are likely to be more dependent on publicly funded social care services.</p>\n<p>Communication needs, with some people unable to communicate through speech, may affect ability to receive an adequate health service, and this may be compounded by existing deprivation. In addition, some may have struggled to receive a diagnosis making it more difficult for them to access the support they need.</p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>Balogh, R, Ouellette-Kuntz, H, Bourne, L, Lunsky, Y and Colantonio, Y.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>While the rate of infant mortality in Reading is similar to the national average, residents who are less affluent and living in more deprived areas are likely to be disproportionately affected by a range of risk factors. Although Reading&#8217;s population is largely affluent, there are areas of deprivation within the borough (Reading Borough Council, 2015) where risk of infant mortality may be higher than average.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Infant mortality is considered a useful indicator of maternal and newborn health and care and is usually expressed as the number of deaths in children under the age of one year, per 1,000 live births (sometimes known as the Infant Mortality Rate or IMR). This takes into account both:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>neonatal deaths (those occurring during the first 28 days of life) (the neonatal mortality rate), and</li>\n<li>the number of infants who die between 28 days and less than one year (the post-neonatal mortality rate).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Between 2012 and 2014, 33 children in Reading died before their 1st birthday &#8211; a rate of 4.2 per 1,000 live births. This is slightly higher than the infant mortality rate of 4.0 per 1,000 live births for England in the same period, but within the range considered statistically similar to the England average.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: IMR in Reading and England (Public Health Outcomes Framework Indicator 4.01)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 1 IMR\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6555/Figure-1-IMR/image/Figure_1_IMR.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 IMR \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 1 IMR</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/public-health-outcomes-framework#page/4/gid/1000044/pat/10039/par/cat-39-7/ati/102/are/E06000038/iid/92196/age/2/sex/4\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a></p>\n<p>Improvements in general healthcare, midwifery and neonatal care have contributed to a continual decrease in the rate of infant mortalities in England and Wales since the early 1900&#8217;s and the rate of this decrease increased substantially between the 1980&#8217;s and 1990&#8217;s. In 2014, as in previous years, mortality rates were much higher in babies of low birth weight, which is often linked to smoking in pregnancy, and in babies born to families with lower incomes. Analysis by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) also confirmed that significant differences in rates of infant and perinatal  mortality continued to exist between socioeconomic groups. These differences have been attributed to poorer maternal health, including greater prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in lower income and routine and manual occupation groups (ONS, 2016).</p>\n<h3>Figure 2: Infant and Perinatal Mortality Rate by Socioeconomic Status</h3>\n<p>​<span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6554/Figure-2/image/Figure_2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 2</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: ONS 2016</p>\n<p>The number of infant deaths in the population is low and when broken down into deaths occurring in smaller areas the numbers become too small to make confident assertions about local trends. The data in Figure 3 shows combined infant mortality rate for 2006-2013 by ward and suggest that the greater numbers of infant deaths in Reading are clustered in ward areas with higher levels of deprivation. Although the wide confidence intervals indicate that this conclusion may not be statistically robust, the results are well supported by various published evidence based on national data.</p>\n<h3>Figure 3: Pooled Infant Mortality Rate 2006-2013 by Reading ward</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6553/Figure-3/image/Figure_3_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 3 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 3</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Primary Care Mortality Database</p>\n<p>Risk factors for infant mortality are complex and interconnected. There are clear links with low birth weight, smoking in pregnancy and higher levels of deprivation, and commentators have also highlighted obesity during pregnancy, ethnicity and country of mother&#8217;s birth, maternal age (especially for those aged under 17 years), whether the mother has previously experienced a stillbirth, and the presence of infection (Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, 2016; ONS 2016).</p>\n<p>Low Birth Weight &#8211; Babies born weighing less than 2,500 grams are at much higher risk of infant mortality and of poor health outcomes through infancy and childhood and in the longer term. Those born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy, who had a poor diet before and during pregnancy, or who are aged younger than 17 years or older than 35 years, and babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are at greatest risk of having low birth weight. The latest information published by Public Health England shows that, in 2014, 3% of babies born at term in Reading had a low birth weight (similar to the England average of 2.9%) (Public Health Outcomes Framework, Indicator 2.01) and between 2012 and 2014 76.4 per 1,000 births in Reading were premature (again, similar to the England average of 77.6 per 1,000 births) (<a href=\"http://www.tobaccoprofiles.info/\">Local Tobacco Control Profiles</a>) (see figures 3 and 4 below).</p>\n<h3>Figure 4: Low birth weight of term babies in Reading compared to England average</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6552/Figure-4/image/Figure_4.png\" alt=\"Figure 4 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 4</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcome Framework (Indicator 2.01)</p>\n<h3>Figure 5: Premature births (less than 37 weeks gestation) in Reading compared to England average</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6551/Figure-5/image/Figure_5.png\" alt=\"Figure 5 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 5</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Local Tobacco Control Profiles</p>\n<p>Smoking in Pregnancy &#8211; In 2014/15, 7.4% of new mothers in Reading in were estimated to be current smokers at the time of giving birth, significantly better than the England average of 11.4% and 12% for areas with similar levels of deprivation to Reading (<a href=\"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/health-profiles/data#page/3/gid/8000073/pat/10039/par/cat-39-7/ati/102/are/E06000038/iid/20301/age/1/sex/2\">Public Health England Health Profile &#8211; Children and Young People&#8217;s Health</a>, from KIT East from the Health and Social Care Information Centre&#8217;s return on Smoking Status At Time of delivery (SSATOD.)</p>\n<h3>Figure 6: Percentage of women smoking at time of delivery in Reading compared to England average</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 6\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6550/Figure-6/image/Figure_6.png\" alt=\"Figure 6 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 6</span></span></p>\n<p>Public Health England Health Profile &#8211; Children and Young People&#8217;s Health, from KIT East from the Health and Social Care Information Centre&#8217;s return on Smoking Status At Time of delivery (SSATOD.)</p>\n<p><em>Deprivation</em> &#8211; Whilst Reading benefits from high employment and high earnings, there are some areas in the borough that are experiencing high and rising levels of deprivation. Between the 2001 census and the most recent census in 2011, two areas in South Reading (the far south of Whitley ward and to the south of Northumberland Avenue in Church ward) fell into the 10% most deprived areas in England. Smoking, poor maternal health and other factors related to infant mortality tend to be more prevalent in more deprived populations (Reading Borough Council, 2015). As elsewhere, smoking prevalence is all adults is higher in those employed in routine and manual occupations (Public Health England, <a href=\"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tobacco-control/data#page/1/ati/102/are/E06000038\">Local Tobacco Control Profiles</a>, 2015)</p>\n<p><em>Teenage Pregnancy</em> &#8211; There is evidence that low birth weight and premature birth are more common in babies born to mothers aged 17 and younger (DCSF/DH, 2010; Fraser, Brockert and Ward, 1995). Teenage conceptions are also positively associated with deprivation, unemployment and children living in poverty (<a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_299768.pdf\">ONS, 2013</a>). The rate of teenage pregnancy in Reading has fallen almost every year in the last ten years and is now statistically similar to the average rates for England and for Local Authority areas with similar levels of deprivation (<a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a>, Indicator 2.04).</p>\n<h2>National and Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>There are a range of complex and interconnected risk factors for infant mortality, many of which are related or correlated to deprivation and living in poverty. A recent report by PHE analysing factors surrounding infant mortality in London highlights the key role of targeting mothers and babies living in poverty in reducing infant mortality (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/431516/Reducing_infant_mortality_in_London_2015.pdf\">PHE, 2015</a>). The report recommends local coordination and care pathways to identify those at risk before conception or birth to reduce the chance of infant death. This includes improving access to contraception and sexual health advice for the most vulnerable and helping to identify women in the early weeks of pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s strategy to reduce inequalities affecting the most deprived people living in Reading takes particular account of the need to reduce rates of teenage pregnancy and increase employment, education and training opportunities for vulnerable and disadvantaged young people (See <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tackling_poverty_needs_analysis_2017_draft_July_18_NEETs_and_debt_updated.pdf\">Tackling Poverty in Reading</a>).</p>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published evidence-based recommendations for helping pregnant women and their partners to stop smoking and for reducing the rates of teenage pregnancy.</p>\n<p><em>Smoking in Pregnancy</em></p>\n<p>NICE recommends that midwives and other health professionals (such as GPs, obstetricians, family nurses) explain the health benefits of quitting and refer those who smoke and partners who smoke to smoking cessation services; midwives should assess pregnant women&#8217;s exposure to tobacco smoke, through discussion and using a carbon monoxide test, and review at subsequent appointments. Smoking cessation providers should ensure they contact all pregnant women referred to them and provide telephone advice or self-help materials to those who do not attend.</p>\n<p>Local smoking cessation services are provided in Reading by Smokefreelife Berkshire. They offer services from the Royal Berkshire Hospital maternity wing where they can support new mothers and fathers to quit.</p>\n<p><em>Reducing Rates of Teenage Pregnancy </em></p>\n<p>NICE recommends that sexual health services are provided to deliver one-to-one sexual health and contraception advice and support for accessing advice about future education, training and employment targeted to vulnerable young people, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are leaving care or who have low educational attainment (See <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph3/chapter/1-Recommendations\">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph3/chapter/1-Recommendations</a>)</p>\n<p>A teenage pregnancy strategy and strategy group has been in place in Reading since 2001. Over the past 14 years, a wide range of services and targeted interventions have been commissioned and put in place to reduce teenage pregnancies. Over the last ten years a progressive downward trend in the teenage pregnancy rate in Reading has suggested that this local strategy is now starting to have a positive impact.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Most of the key indicators associated with infant mortality for Reading are similar to the national average; however, those who are less affluent and living in more deprived areas are likely to be disproportionately affected by a range of risk factors. Although Reading&#8217;s population is largely affluent, there are areas of extreme deprivation within the borough (Reading Borough Council, 2015) where risk of infant mortality may be higher than average.</p>\n<p>Some of the risks are less clear than others. For instance, more information is needed about the relationship between ethnicity and parent&#8217;s place of birth and the risk of infant mortality in order to fully understand the needs of Reading&#8217;s ethnically diverse population.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs or gaps in service?</h2>\n<p>Targeting resources on the most deprived and disadvantaged to reduce smoking in pregnancy, reduce teenage pregnancy, improve maternal nutrition and diet and improve and encourage access to maternal health services, especially in the early weeks of pregnancy, are likely to help to reduce the local rate of infant mortality.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/smoking-in-pregnancy/\">Smoking in pregnancy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/deprivation-by-ward-and-lower-super-output-area/\">Deprivation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/teenage-pregnancy-rates/\">Teenage pregnancy</a></p>\n<p>Also see: <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tackling_poverty_needs_analysis_2017_draft_July_18_NEETs_and_debt_updated.pdf\">Tackling Poverty in Reading</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (2016). <em>Infant Mortality and Stillbirth in the UK</em>.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Reading Borough Council recognises the importance of stable, affordable and decent housing in terms of health, wellbeing and narrowing the gaps in outcomes across the town between the most and least affluent.</p>\n<p>With a strong and buoyant economy, Reading has been in a comparatively robust position to cope with the recent economic downturn. In 2016 Reading was again ranked top in the Good Growth for Cities index for the second year running, based on indicators considered key to economic success and wellbeing (including employment, health, income and skills) (PWC, 2016). In its report Cities Outlook 2016, Centre for Cities ranked the Greater Reading area as second in the UK for the economic contribution per worker (<a href=\"http://www.centreforcities.org/city/reading/\">Centre for Cities Factsheet, 2016</a>).</p>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s appeal both to employers and employees is one reason that the local housing market is in high demand across all tenures. Demand for affordable housing in Reading significantly outstrips supply, due to a range of factors including a limited pipeline of new build affordable housing, reducing social housing stock through Right to Buy sales, high land prices, and a reducing supply of affordable private rented sector housing at Local Housing Allowance (LHA) levels.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>At least every five years all local authorities have a duty to review homelessness in their area and publish a strategy that outlines how they intend to tackle and prevent homelessness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Appendix_1-_HOMELESSNESS_STRATEGY_2016-2021_FINAL.pdf\">Homelessness Strategy 2016-21</a></p>\n<p>Key housing data for Reading from the 2011 census data shows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>66,445 Dwellings in Reading\n<ul>\n<li>10.7% &#8211; Local Authority Owned</li>\n<li>6.1% &#8211; Registered Provider Owned</li>\n<li>83.1% Privately owned</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>62,869 households in Reading\n<ul>\n<li>Owner occupier &#8211; 34,479 (54.8%)</li>\n<li>Shared ownership &#8211; 1,130 (1.8%)</li>\n<li>Local Authority Rented &#8211; 6,322 (10%)</li>\n<li>Registered Provider Rented &#8211; 3,920 (6.2%)</li>\n<li>Privately Rented &#8211; 16,394 (26%)</li>\n<li>Living rent free &#8211; 624 (1%)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Number of homes</strong>: There were 66,328 residential dwellings in Reading Local Authority in 2011. Reading Borough Council is still a stock-holding authority and therefore both the largest landlord and social housing provider in the borough with 10% of overall dwellings. 6% are housing association dwellings.</p>\n<p>55% are owned outright or with a mortgage, which is significantly lower than the National and regional averages. In turn, over 25% are privately rented which is higher than National average.</p>\n<p><strong>Affordability</strong>: Reading has twice the national average of properties that are privately rented. This is due to the high level of demand in the area created by the enduring economy, attracting young professionals to the town. Therefore, although cheaper properties can be found, the average rent for a private rented property is high.</p>\n<p>The average price of a home in Reading is approximately 230K; this is in line with national averages (<a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/housing_databank\">Shelter Housing Databank</a>).</p>\n<p>The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) provides an up to date assessment of housing need in Berkshire and breaks that down for each authority area.  The net estimated level of affordable housing need per annum in Reading is 406 dwellings.  The SHMA shows that 76% of this need is for social rent and affordable rent dwellings with only 24% of the identified need being able to afford intermediate products such as shared ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Housing</strong>: All Council and Housing Association properties in the borough are let through Reading Borough Council&#8217;s Choice Based Lettings Scheme. Applicants are awarded priority for housing based on their level of housing need, taking into account criteria such as overcrowding, homelessness, or medical or welfare needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Homelessness</strong>: Statutory homelessness refers to households meeting specific criteria set out in legislation, and to whom a homelessness duty has been accepted by a local authority. Such households may be homeless, but are more likely to be threatened with the loss of, or are unable to continue with, their current accommodation.</p>\n<p>A &#8220;main homelessness duty&#8221; is owed where the authority is satisfied that the applicant is eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and falls within a specified priority need group. Such statutory homeless households are referred to as &#8220;acceptances&#8221;. Local Authorities have a duty to provide temporary accommodation for households who have been accepted by the Local Authority as homeless whilst settled accommodation is found. Temporary accommodations include Bed and Breakfasts (B&amp;Bs), hostels and night shelters.</p>\n<p>Following a long term downward trend in homelessness since 2004, homeless acceptances have been increasing nationally and locally. Due to a shortage of affordable permanent accommodation, the use of temporary accommodation and B&amp;B has grown &#8211; with an increase in the number of placements and length of stay over recent years. This is unsuitable, unsettling and disruptive for homeless households. The sharply increasing demand in Reading for emergency housing has also led to a need to make B&amp;B placements out of borough in some instances, which creates further problems for households.</p>\n<h2>Current Homelessness figures:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Average this year of 50 homeless presentations a month</li>\n<li>Average of 23 homelessness acceptances per month</li>\n<li>Currently have 255 people in temporary accommodation</li>\n<li>Currently have 123 people in B &amp; B</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Objectively Assessed Housing Need</h2>\n<p>The figures emerging from the Berkshire Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) indicate an objectively assessed need for housing in Reading of 699 dwellings per year in the period to 2036.  This represents a 22% increase over the current rate of provision.  The Council is now about to start a review of its local plan which will primarily seek to set out a strategy to meet future development requirements.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>In order to manage the pressure of increasing homelessness the Council has taken  a number of steps to manage the use of Bed and Breakfast and to meet the needs of homeless households, including the following:</p>\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\n<p>The Council&#8217;s Housing Advice team takes an active approach to preventing homelessness. Wherever possible the service will support and enable a household to remain in their home and, where needed, to gain the skills to effectively sustain their tenancy in the future. The Authority has reconfigured the way that front line services are delivered to provide a triage service to maximise opportunities to identify risks and prevent homelessness at the earliest possible stage.</p>\n<h2>Supporting both Landlords and Tenants</h2>\n<p>The Council is providing additional advice and support to private sector landlords so that we create and maintain excellent working relationships with them in order to raise standards of practice and accommodation and maximise opportunities for preventing homelessness. The authority is active in tackling rogue landlords and driving up standards in the private rented sector.</p>\n<p>The Housing Needs Service has commissioned a single provider, Launchpad, to provide housing related support to vulnerable individuals and families who may require assistance in maintaining a tenancy. Both the Council and other funded agencies offer money management advice and pre-tenancy training on tenants&#8217; rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<h2>Temporary Accommodation</h2>\n<p>The Council has already taken steps to refurbish and increase the supply of temporary accommodation by re-modelling former temporary accommodation which had been unused for some time as they were not fit for purpose and were not required at the time. 18 self-contained units were opened in March 2014 and a further 17 units in June/July 2015. This is in addition to an existing block of temporary accommodation providing 50 self-contained flats.</p>\n<h2>A Safe and Trusted Supply of Private Rented Housing</h2>\n<p>The Housing Service has run a successful Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) for many years which enables the Council to prevent homelessness by providing access to affordable and vetted private rented sector accommodation. Households can move into accommodation without the need for a deposit, as this is guaranteed by the Council. The Council only pays out on a deposit should the tenant cause damage in a property or abandon the property with rent arrears. The scheme has a facility set up to enable households to save for their own deposit during the course of their tenancy which enables them to be financially independent and self-sufficient moving forward.</p>\n<p>Properties on the scheme are vetted and must meet required standards. The Council inspects every property before accepting it onto the scheme to ensure it meets legal, and health and safety standards. If work is needed on a property then the Council will advise a landlord on how to meet the standards.</p>\n<p>The scheme creates a safe and trusted supply of private rented sector accommodation and the majority of tenants have chosen to remain in the accommodation they were offered even after they have saved their own deposit.</p>\n<p>Numbers of properties procured on the scheme have been lower in recent years mainly due to the increase in market rent in relation to Local Housing Allowance. The Council therefore undertook a comprehensive review of the scheme and extensive consultation with landlords to develop a new offer to increase the number of units procured.</p>\n<p>The new &#8216;Rent Guarantee Scheme&#8217; took on its first properties in July 2015 and was launched formally in September 2015. This Council has listened to landlord feedback and the new more commercial scheme offers landlords a completely free service which includes the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 weeks deposit guarantee (previously 4 weeks)</li>\n<li>Competitive guaranteed rental income paid monthly in advance directly into the landlord&#8217;s bank account by the Council &#8211; this reduces financial risk and protects income for landlords (the Council collects rent directly from tenants)</li>\n<li>Rent paid during void periods</li>\n<li>Property viewings arranged within a day and properties are let within 3-4 days</li>\n<li>Video inventories at the start and end of the tenancy</li>\n<li>Grants available for property upgrades to improve energy efficiency</li>\n<li>Reference-checked tenants to choose from</li>\n<li>Quarterly visits to a landlord&#8217;s property whilst the tenant is in situ.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The scheme provides wider confidential support and advice to landlords with any tenancy issues and also provides support to tenants to ensure households are equipped with the skills to successfully maintain a tenant</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Berkshire Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) identified housing demand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need 699 dwellings per year (22% more than we previously thought)</li>\n<li>Need 406 affordable dwellings per year &#8211; 76% as rented and 24% intermediate/ shared</li>\n<li>58% of all dwellings need to be affordable, and 44% of all dwellings need to be affordable rented properties to meet need.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For those in acute need (bands A-C) 1 bed properties are requested the most (47%) followed by 2 bed properties (37%), however this is projected to change in the next 2 years with 2 beds becoming the property size most in demand.</li>\n<li>There still remains some demand for 3 bedroom properties and bigger, and demand may grow in 2/3 years but supply should contain this pressure &#8211; short term need is 2 beds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2014 the Government announced that Crossrail will be extended to Reading and it has been predicted that this will further impact housing demand and costs. The Crossrail Property Impact Study 2012 predicted that property prices will rise 2% and rental prices will rise 1% in the first stage of the scheme (2012-2017) as a result of the west section of the line being developed, increasing from 2018 onwards to 3.5% for property prices and 2% for rental prices</p>\n<p>Extensive examination and analysis of demand and trends in the causes of homelessness, opportunities for homelessness prevention, service provision and gaps in services has informed the basis for our priorities for Reading Borough Council&#8217;s Homelessness Strategy.</p>\n<p>A number of workshops with those responsible for delivering the action plan for our previous Homelessness Strategy identified the key areas of focus for an initial round of consultation with key stakeholders via questionnaire. Residents who had used homelessness services were encouraged to contribute through workshops arranged as part of existing service user groups.</p>\n<p>A final series of stakeholder workshops and review of the latest available data on homelessness in Reading (and the wider influences on the local situation) has led to the identification of three key strategic priorities for this Homelessness Strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase the use and accessibility of the private rented sector</li>\n<li>Prevent homelessness by supporting people to access housing and to sustain their accommodation</li>\n<li>Increase the information and advice available to enable people to make informed decisions about their housing situation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of social housing there is a particular need for housing for families (defined as households with children living in overcrowded conditions) who are generally the highest priority for housing.</p>\n<p>It its recognised that this need cannot be met only via the delivery of new homes; creative approaches are necessary to meet this need. Including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tenant Incentive Scheme &#8211; Tackling under occupation in current social housing stock by offering tenants incentives to downsize and free up larger sized accommodation for availability to families.</li>\n<li>Casework to assess other options to reduce overcrowding for households, for example, assisting adult non-dependants into their own tenancy or considering options in the private sector with the support of Reading Deposit Guarantee Scheme.</li>\n<li>Assessing a household&#8217;s current property for practical measures to increase space and reduce over-crowding, including the use of Disabled Facilities Grant for families with disabled children.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading Borough Council sees the provision of affordable housing as a high priority and uses all available means to improve the supply of affordable housing in the Borough</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Centre for Cities (2016).

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Although there is no consensus around a single definition of wellbeing, there is general agreement that at a minimum, wellbeing includes the presence of positive emotions and moods (e.g., contentment, happiness), the absence of negative emotions (e.g., depression, anxiety), satisfaction with life, fulfilment and positive functioning (Frey and Stutzer, 2002). Veenhoven (2008) agrees with this and has described wellbeing as judging life positively and feeling good. From a public health perspective, physical wellbeing is also viewed as critical to overall wellbeing. Researchers from different disciplines (Strine et.al, 2008) have examined different aspects of well-being that include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical well-being</li>\n<li>Economic well-being</li>\n<li>Social well-being</li>\n<li>Development and activity</li>\n<li>Emotional well-being</li>\n<li>Psychological well-being</li>\n<li>Life satisfaction</li>\n<li>Domain specific satisfaction</li>\n<li>Engaging activities and work</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Health is more than the absence of disease; it is a resource that allows people to realize their aspirations, satisfy their needs and to cope with the environment in order to live a long, productive, and fruitful life (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). Health consequently aids social, economic and personal development central to well-being.</p>\n<p>Environmental and social resources for health can include: peace, economic security, a stable ecosystem, and safe housing while individually, resources for health can include: physical activity, healthy diet, social ties, resilience, positive emotions, and autonomy. Therefore, health promotion activities aimed at strengthening such individual, environmental and social resources may ultimately improve well-being (Herrman, Saxena and Moodie, 2005).</p>\n<p>Well-being is a valid population outcome measure beyond morbidity, mortality, and economic status that tells us how people perceive their life is going from their own perspective (Diener, Scollon and Lucas, 2009). Lyubomirsky, King and Diener (2005) also associate wellbeing with numerous health, job, family, and economically-related benefits arguing that higher levels of wellbeing are associated with decreased risk of disease, illness, and injury; better immune functioning; speedier recovery; and increased longevity. Individuals with high levels of well-being have also been found to be more productive at work and are more likely to contribute to their communities (Tov &amp; Diener, 2008), thus strengthening the arguments that wellbeing is an outcome that is meaningful to the public.</p>\n<p>According to a report by The Kings Fund, older people report that what matters most to them in terms of wellbeing and quality of life include: the ability to remain at home in clean, warm, affordable accommodation; to remain socially engaged; to continue with activities that give their life meaning; to contribute to their family or community; to feel safe and to maintain independence, choice, control, personal appearance and dignity; to be free from discrimination; and to feel they are not a &#8216;burden&#8217; to their own families and that they can continue their own role as caregivers (Tadd et al 2010).</p>\n<p>There is increasing evidence that adopting healthy lifestyles can yield health benefits and maintaining behaviours such as regular exercise, smoking cessation, reducing alcohol consumption, healthy eating, and preventing obesity has a protective effect well into retirement (Rizzuto et al 2012).</p>\n<h2>Facts, figures and trends</h2>\n<p>Personal well-being is one of the domains in the national wellbeing programme. Estimates for personal wellbeing are based on data from the Annual Population Survey, which includes responses from around 165,000 people. This is a relatively large representative sample of adults aged 16 and over living in residential households in the UK.</p>\n<p>The latest personal wellbeing estimates suggest year-on-year improvements in reported wellbeing since 2011/12, when Office of National Statistics (ONS) started to collect the data. Over this three-year period, there have been small but significant improvements in average personal wellbeing ratings in each UK country and across all four measures of wellbeing.</p>\n<p>The percentage of people reporting higher levels of life satisfaction, feeling that the things they do in life are worthwhile and happiness levels all increased while the percentage reporting higher levels of anxiety declined. Between 2011/12 and 2012/13, there was a small but significant improvement in anxiety levels among those who rated their health as &#8216;very good&#8217;, &#8216;good&#8217;, or &#8216;fair&#8217;. There were no significant changes for any wellbeing measures among those who rated their health negatively.</p>\n<p>In 2013/14, the average ratings for each of the four measures of personal wellbeing were: 7.5 out of 10 for life satisfaction; 7.4 out of 10 for happiness yesterday; 7.7 out of 10 for feeling that what one does in life is worthwhile; 2.9 out of 10 for anxiety yesterday.</p>\n<p>The proportions of people reporting the highest levels of personal wellbeing have grown since 2011/12 for each of the four measures. The greatest gain has been in reduced anxiety levels. The proportion of people in the UK reporting very low anxiety grew between 2011/2012 and 2013/2014 (<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/measuringnationalwellbeing/2015-09-23\">ONS, 2015</a>).</p>\n<p>Unemployed people continued to rate their personal wellbeing much lower than those who were employed, but both employed and unemployed people rated their personal wellbeing significantly higher on average in 2013/14 than 2011/12. This may reflect a higher degree of optimism now that the economy is improving and a perception that employment opportunities may also be improving. However, personal wellbeing ratings fell among those who are not in work due to long-term sickness or disability.</p>\n<p>These people may face multiple challenges to personal wellbeing, being both out of work and in poor health or disabled. They are also least able to take advantage of improving employment opportunities.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF) includes 4 indicators for wellbeing, which are taken from the ONS Annual Population Survey. These measure the percentage (%) of people who have low levels of wellbeing for each of the 4 measures. These all improved from 2012/13 to 2013/14. 5.6% of people had a low life satisfaction score (0-4 out of 10); 9.7% of people had a low happiness score (0-4out of 10) (<a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health England: PHOF indicators</a> 2.23i &#8211; 2.23iv).</p>\n<p>Personal wellbeing measures are taken from the annual population survey and provide estimates at a national, regional and local authority level. The number of people who responded to the wellbeing questions in Reading varied from 901 to 906 depending on the question.</p>\n<p>Life Satisfaction: the survey asked, &#8220;Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?&#8221; (0 is &#8216;not at all satisfied&#8217;; 10 is &#8216;completely satisfied&#8217;).</p>\n<p>In 2013/14, the average life satisfaction score in Reading was 7.52 out of 10. This was comparable to the England figure of 7.49 out of 10. PHOF indicator 2.23i measures the % of the population who have low satisfaction levels.</p>\n<p>Data has not been published for Reading for 2013/14, as the confidence levels were too high to be validated.</p>\n<p>Worthwhile: the survey asked &#8220;Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile? (0 is &#8216;not at all worthwhile&#8217;; 10 is &#8216;completely worthwhile&#8217;).</p>\n<p>In 2013/14, the average worthwhile score in Reading was 7.84 out of 10.

This is comparable to the England figure of 7.37 out of 10. 5.8% of people reported that they had a low feeling of happiness in Reading (0-4 out of 10), which was significantly better than the national figure of 9.7%. This was also an improvement on previous years, although the change was not significant.</p>\n<p>Anxiety: the survey asked &#8220;Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?</p>\n<p>(0 is &#8216;not at all anxious&#8217;; 10 is &#8216;completely anxious&#8217;).</p>\n<p>At approximately 20%, the self-reported feeling of anxiety in Reading was significantly better than the England average at approximately 30% for the year 2013/14.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Estimated levels of personal wellbeing in Reading (2013/14)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5225/image1/image/image1_1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics.

The over 65 population, and particularly the over 85 population, is also expected to rise steadily in Reading. It is known that older people, especially those aged 75 and over, are vulnerable to social isolation which can impact on their physical and mental health.

Veenhoven (2008) agrees with this and has described wellbeing as judging life positively and feeling good. From a public health perspective, physical wellbeing is also viewed as critical to overall wellbeing. Researchers from different disciplines (Strine et.al, 2008) have examined different aspects of well-being that include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical well-being</li>\n<li>Economic well-being</li>\n<li>Social well-being</li>\n<li>Development and activity</li>\n<li>Emotional well-being</li>\n<li>Psychological well-being</li>\n<li>Life satisfaction</li>\n<li>Domain specific satisfaction</li>\n<li>Engaging activities and work</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Health is more than the absence of disease; it is a resource that allows people to realize their aspirations, satisfy their needs and to cope with the environment in order to live a long, productive, and fruitful life (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). Health consequently aids social, economic and personal development central to well-being.</p>\n<p>Environmental and social resources for health can include: peace, economic security, a stable ecosystem, and safe housing while individually, resources for health can include: physical activity, healthy diet, social ties, resilience, positive emotions, and autonomy. Therefore, health promotion activities aimed at strengthening such individual, environmental and social resources may ultimately improve well-being (Herrman, Saxena and Moodie, 2005).</p>\n<p>Well-being is a valid population outcome measure beyond morbidity, mortality, and economic status that tells us how people perceive their life is going from their own perspective (Diener, Scollon and Lucas, 2009). Lyubomirsky, King and Diener (2005) also associate wellbeing with numerous health, job, family, and economically-related benefits arguing that higher levels of wellbeing are associated with decreased risk of disease, illness, and injury; better immune functioning; speedier recovery; and increased longevity. Individuals with high levels of well-being have also been found to be more productive at work and are more likely to contribute to their communities (Tov &amp; Diener, 2008), thus strengthening the arguments that wellbeing is an outcome that is meaningful to the public.</p>\n<p>According to a report by The Kings Fund, older people report that what matters most to them in terms of wellbeing and quality of life include: the ability to remain at home in clean, warm, affordable accommodation; to remain socially engaged; to continue with activities that give their life meaning; to contribute to their family or community; to feel safe and to maintain independence, choice, control, personal appearance and dignity; to be free from discrimination; and to feel they are not a &#8216;burden&#8217; to their own families and that they can continue their own role as caregivers (Tadd et al 2010).</p>\n<p>There is increasing evidence that adopting healthy lifestyles can yield health benefits and maintaining behaviours such as regular exercise, smoking cessation, reducing alcohol consumption, healthy eating, and preventing obesity has a protective effect well into retirement (Rizzuto et al 2012).</p>\n<h2>Facts, figures and trends</h2>\n<p>Personal well-being is one of the domains in the national wellbeing programme.

Reading&#8217;s Local Safeguarding Children&#8217;s Board (LSCB) has responded to the potential of a high incidence of hidden cases by seeking to strengthen Reading&#8217;s local response to FGM and, in collaboration with local partners and communities, has developed advice for professionals on reporting appropriately to Police and Children&#8217;s Services, seeking medical care and assessing risks to female relatives of victims.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) refers to procedures that intentionally alter or remove part or all of the external female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice is medically unnecessary, has no health benefit and is extremely painful and harmful to victims, both at the time the mutilation is carried out and in later life. The practice is associated with initiation rites for young girls originating in a swath of countries across North and West Africa. In some cases, these practices have continued to be taken up by certain minority and immigrant communities living in countries in Europe and North America, including the UK. The practice was previously widely referred to as &#8216;female circumcision&#8217;, but the current term is now usually considered more appropriate as it reflects the more harmful nature of FGM compared to male circumcision.</p>\n<p>FGM has been a criminal offence in the UK since the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act was passed in 1985. In 2003, this was replaced by the Female Genital Mutilation Act, which also made it an offence for UK nationals, permanent or habitual UK residents to carry out FGM abroad, or to aid, abet, counsel or procure the carrying out of FGM, even in countries where the practice is legal. The 2015 Serious Crime Act amended the FGM Act, making it illegal for responsible adults to fail to protect a girl from FGM, introducing legal powers to protect girls at risk of FGM, protecting the anonymity of victims of FGM and creating a duty of mandatory reporting for health and social care professionals in England and Wales (WHO, 2016; Reading Borough Council Safeguarding Children Board, 2016, UNICEF, 2013).</p>\n<p>The procedures typically involved in FGM vary from case to case but are classified in the following 4 major types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type 1: clitoridectomy &#8211; partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals), and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris)</li>\n<li>Type 2: excision &#8211; partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without excision of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva )</li>\n<li>Type 3: infibulation &#8211; the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).</li>\n<li>Type 4: all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(WHO, 2016).</p>\n<p>As well as the immediate health implications associated with the practice (including severe pain, excessive bleeding, tissue damage, fever, shock, and risk of infection or fatal haemorrhage), longer term consequences can include complications in pregnancy and childbirth, painful urination and urinary tract infection, painful menstruation, vaginal infection, and sexual and psychological problems (WHO, 2016, Reading Borough Council, 2016).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>No reliable data exist to indicate the number of girls and women in a locality who have undergone or are at risk of FGM. In 2014 a national report commissioned by Trust for London and the Home Office and produced by City University London and Equality Now estimated that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some 60,000 girls aged 14 or younger had been born in England and Wales to mothers who had undergone FGM;</li>\n<li>approximately 103,000 women aged 15-49 and approximately 24,000 women aged 50 or older who have migrated to England and Wales were living with the consequences of FGM; and</li>\n<li>approximately 10,000 girls aged under 15 who have migrated to England and Wales are considered likely to have undergone FGM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of FGM cases in any given area is likely to be linked to migration patterns, prevailing trends in incidence and acceptability of FGM in the country from which women and girls have emigrated and the extent to which they integrate with other communities and are influenced by normative cultural practices. (McFarlane and Dorkenoo, 2014; UNICEF, 2013). In 2015, McFarlane and Dorkenoo went on to estimate the number of maternities to women with FGM by Local Authority area and estimated that there would be 437 maternities in an eight year period (roughly 54 per year) in Reading, but the report also highlights that these estimates may not reflect lower rates of FGM among certain populations, particularly women with secondary and higher education.</p>\n<p>Reading has a higher than average level of international migration and the 2011 census indicates populations of 465 residents born in North Africa and 2418 born in Central and Western Africa, ranking Reading 42nd and 23rd respectively amongst 348 Local Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities in England and Wales for the proportion of the population from the regions. While this suggests the likelihood of a higher number than in other areas, the difficulty in assessing the influence of the other factors mentioned above makes it difficult to make any definitive statement comparing incidence with other localities.</p>\n<p>Since September 2014, all health and social care providers in England and Wales have been required to return monthly aggregated data about cases of FGM identified. This includes both newly identified cases and those who are currently being treated for FGM-related conditions. Data collected by providers in England are collated in the &#8216;FGM enhanced dataset&#8217; and are publicly available via the NHS Digital website. The first annual report was published in July 2016. Caution is advised when interpreting the data as data completeness and quality is sometimes low and varies between providers.</p>\n<p>Providers are required to record 1) newly identified cases of FGM and 2) total attendances (i.e. includes both newly identified and previously identified cases). Data are published at CCG, Local Authority and NHS Trust level.</p>\n<p>Table 1: Number of reported new cases of FGM and total attendances of women or girls living with FGM by CCG, NHS Trust and Local Authority.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Table 1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>CCG, LA or Trust</th>\n<th>Newly identified cases</th>\n<th>Total attendances</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>North and West Reading CCG</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>South Reading CCG</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Royal Berkshire NHS Trust</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading (Local Authority)</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>South of England</td>\n<td>620</td>\n<td>1,055</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total England</td>\n<td>5,702</td>\n<td>8,856</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2016.</p>\n<p>Table 2: Number of reported new cases of FGM and total attendances of women or girls living with FGM in Local Authority areas with highest incidence.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Table 2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Local Authority</th>\n<th>Newly identified cases</th>\n<th>Total attendances</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Birmingham</td>\n<td>435</td>\n<td>520</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bristol</td>\n<td>385</td>\n<td>705</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brent</td>\n<td>325</td>\n<td>1250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manchester</td>\n<td>310</td>\n<td>350</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Southwark</td>\n<td>290</td>\n<td>320</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2016.</p>\n<p>Table 3: Number of reported new cases of FGM and total attendances of women or girls living with FGM in Local Authority similar to Reading.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Table 3\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>CCG, LA or Trust</th>\n<th>Newly identified cases</th>\n<th>Total attendances</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Southampton</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Portsmouth</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slough</td>\n<td>55</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Swindon</td>\n<td>&gt;5</td>\n<td>&gt;5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lambeth</td>\n<td>175</td>\n<td>200</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2016.</p>\n<p>While these data cannot currently be interpreted with confidence, they indicate a higher number of cases than some similar Local Authority areas in the South, but much lower than areas in London and the Local Authority levels with the highest incidence.</p>\n<h2>National Strategy</h2>\n<p>In 2016 the Government published its updated &#8216;Multi-Agency Statutory Guidance on Female Genital Mutilation&#8217;. The guidance seeks to provide both strategic guidance and advice and support to frontline professionals and recommends that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the organisation should have a lead person whose role includes responsibility for FGM and a member of staff who has undertaken additional training to understand FGM;</li>\n<li>staff understand the role in protecting children from abuse, including FGM, know how to refer and report cases, and share information appropriately;</li>\n<li>there should be a policy in place to protect those who have undergone or are at risk of FGM that reflects multi-agency working arrangements;</li>\n<li>the organisation takes safeguarding seriously and takes a victim-centred approach;</li>\n<li>Commissioning leads should understand and make use of the data relating to their local communities and ensure that services are provided to meet the physical and mental health needs of women and girls who have undergone FGM;</li>\n<li>Staff should be trained to discharge their safeguarding duties with regard to FGM; and</li>\n<li>Organisations should involve local communities and community groups in discussions about how FGM can be ended and encourage reporting of FGM;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Local Strategy</h2>\n<p>Reading has a higher than average level of residents born in North and Central and Western Africa. While there are many other factors that affect the number of women and girls who have undergone FGM in a locality area, Reading&#8217;s Local Safeguarding Children&#8217;s Board (LSCB) has responded to a potential high incidence rate by seeking to strengthen Reading&#8217;s local response to FGM. The board works with the Alliance for Cohesion and Racial Equality (ACRE), a Reading-based voluntary sector organisation working to raise awareness and prevent FGM, and facilitates access to fact sheets, assessment tools and online training for professionals. The Board&#8217;s Procedures Manual sets out recommendations for assessing risk of FGM and recommending action to be taken. The board suggests that the following may indicate where a child may be at risk of FGM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A female child is born to a woman who has undergone FGM or whose older sibling or cousin has undergone FGM;</li>\n<li>The family belongs to a community in which FGM is practised and has a limited level of integration with UK community:</li>\n<li>The family indicates that there are strong levels of influence held by elders or that elders are involved in bringing up female children;</li>\n<li>If a female family elder is present, particularly if she is visiting from a country of origin, and taking a more active/influential role in the family;</li>\n<li>The family makes preparation for the child to take a holiday, e.g. arranging vaccinations, planning an absence from school;</li>\n<li>The child talks about a &#8216;special procedure&#8217; or &#8216;ceremony&#8217; that is going to take place;</li>\n<li>An awareness by a midwife or obstetrician that the procedure has already been carried out on a mother, prompting concern for any daughters, girls or young women in the family;</li>\n<li>Repeated failure to attend or engage with health and welfare services or the mother of a girl is very reluctant to undergo genital examination;</li>\n<li>Where a girl from a practising community is withdrawn from Sex and Relationship Education they may be at risk from their parents wishing to keep them uninformed about their body and rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the board suggests the following may indicate that FGM has already taken place:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The child has changed in behaviour after a prolonged absence from school;</li>\n<li>The child has health problems, particularly bladder or menstrual problems;</li>\n<li>The child has difficulty walking, sitting or standing and may appear to be uncomfortable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Board has developed 4 pathways for referring women and girls who are at risk or have undergone FGM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Girl aged under 18 years at risk or suspected of having undergone of FGM</li>\n<li>Girl aged under 18 years who has undergone FGM</li>\n<li>Pregnant woman who has or is suspected of having undergone FGM</li>\n<li>Non-pregnant woman who has or is suspected of having undergone FGM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pathways advise professionals about how and when police should be alerted, how and when to refer to Children&#8217;s Services, how and where to seek medical care, and when to undertake risk assessments of female relatives.</p>\n<p>A nurse led Safeguarding Service at the Royal Berkshire Hospital focuses on FGM detection and control in the West of Berkshire area and has a close working relationship with the Reading social care services. All referrals from the Hospital are screened and at-risk cases are followed up by Reading&#8217;s Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH).</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>FGM is illegal and tends to be hidden. Processes for collecting data in NHS and other care settings have only been mandated since September 2014 and data returned is incomplete and unreliable. Initial published reports suggest that 30 women self-reporting FGM were seen in Reading in 2015-2016. This is higher than in some similar locality areas in the South East but much lower than reported elsewhere, especially in large cities and London boroughs.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</h2>\n<p>While the number of women and girls reporting FGM is lower than seen elsewhere and lower than may be expected given high levels of immigration in Reading, it is difficult to know whether this reflects a true picture, or whether a large number of cases are undetected. Reading LSCB has highlighted the need to provide ongoing care to meet the physical and emotional health needs of women who have undergone FGM. An increase in provision may be effective in bringing unreported cases into contact with health and social care services.</p>\n<p>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/migration/\">Migration</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/maternity/\">Maternity</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Geneva, WHO.

However, since the number of deaths used for this calculation at Local Authority level is small, confidence in these data to demonstrate significant differences is limited.</p>\n<p>2014/15 saw a national increase in the number of excess winter deaths, with the biggest increases amongst men under 85 and women over 85. The rate of excess winter deaths in Reading has continued to fall closer to the national average in 2014/15, but the rate amongst women increased to above the national average between 2010-13 and 2011-14.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Cold weather in the UK is associated with increase in death and ill health from heart attack, stroke, lung diseases, flu and other conditions, as well as injuries from falls in icy or snowy conditions and hypothermia. In recent years there have typically been between 18,000 and 25,000 additional deaths in England between December and March, a higher rate than seen in some colder Northern European countries (PHE, 2015; NICE, 2015), but the number was much higher in 2014/15 &#8211; reaching 43,900 deaths (see Figure 1, below).</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: Number of excess winter deaths and five year central moving average, England and Wales (1950/51 &#8211; 2014/15)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><a title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5606/Figure-1/large/Figure_1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5606/Figure-1/image/Figure_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 Displays a larger version of this image in a new browser window\" /></a><br />\n</span></p>\n<p><em>Source: Office for National Statistics</em></p>\n<p>Most winter deaths are caused by respiratory and cardiovascular problems at normal winter temperatures. Although risks increase as the temperature falls further (NICE, 2015), the link between average winter temperature and mortality is not straightforward (ONS, 2015). For example, although the winter of 2009/10 was usually cold, the number of winter deaths fell in comparison to the previous year (see Figure 2, below). Some analysis suggests that, as cold weather may occur outside of the designated &#8216;winter months&#8217; (December to March) it may be difficult to observe any correlation between cold weather and high mortality rates using this standard measure (NICE, 2015).</p>\n<h3>Figure 2: Number of excess winter deaths and average winter temperature, England and Wales (1999/2000 &#8211; 2014/15)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><a title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5607/Figure-2/large/Figure_2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5607/Figure-2/image/Figure_2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2 Displays a larger version of this image in a new browser window\" /></a><br />\n</span></p>\n<p><em>Source: Office for National Statistics</em></p>\n<p>Although there is agreement that influenza incidence influences excess winter deaths, there is some divergence between authorities on this complex relationship (ONS, 2015; NICE, 2015).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>The Excess Winter Death (EWD) index calculates the number of winter deaths (deaths that occur between December and March compared to the expected number of deaths in a four month period), and expresses it as a percentage of the total number of expected deaths. The EWD for Reading for all ages for 2011-2014 was 19.1. This is higher than both the national average of 15.6 and the average amongst Local Authorities with similar levels of deprivation of 14.7. Since the number of deaths used for this calculation at Local Authority level is small, confidence in these data to demonstrate significant differences is limited.

These may be related to additional difficulties with self-care or vulnerability to other conditions and to falls and injuries. A change to the way in which diseases are recorded may account for some of this increase (ONS, 2015).

The guidance recommends strategic planning to help ensure that homes are properly insulated and heated.</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s Winter Watch programme, run in partnership with key local voluntary and health sector partners, operates between December and March and provides support to vulnerable residents to heat and insulate their homes. There are also a number of events to raise awareness.</p>\n<p>Local implementation of immunisation against influenza in Reading has been successful.

Death occurs in a wide variety of settings from hospitals, care homes and hospices to the home. Many people will be transferred several times between these different settings in their final year. Subsequently, being responsive to their individual needs and preferences is an enormous challenge.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The National End of Life Care Intelligence Network (NEoLCIN) collects analyses and presents end of life care intelligence from a wide variety of sources. In 2014 a report was published to summarise the key findings of the network and its partners over the last year. Although much of the research has been published previously, this is the first time it has been brought together in one place.</p>\n<p>Key findings from the report are summarised below;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The proportion of people dying at home or in care homes continues to increase</li>\n<li>Patients with an Electronic Palliative Care Co-ordination System (EPaCCS) record and those receiving palliative care services such as hospice at home, Gold Standards Framework or Macmillan services are more likely to die in the place of their preference</li>\n<li>Two in five people with dementia die in hospital, indicating that the trend towards increasing hospital deaths for people living with dementia has reversed</li>\n<li>Factors most important to people at the end of their life were; having pain and other symptoms managed effectively, being surrounded by loved ones and being treated with dignity</li>\n<li>More GPs are having conversations with people about their end of life care wishes but 25% still say they have never initiated such a conversation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>Data from the National End of Life Care Intelligence Network for England 2014/15 identified 470,541 deaths registered as EOL of which 47% (222,076) died in a hospital setting and 45% in their usual place of residence. Usual place of residence includes a care home and the percentage split between home and care home is equal.</p>\n<p>For Berkshire West there were 3297 deaths (all diagnosis) registered as EOL of which 48% died in a hospital setting and 45% in their usual place of residence (home 24% and care home 21%) reflecting the national picture.</p>\n<p>Please refer to other sections of the JSNA which show population characteristics and the prevalence of life limiting conditions in the local area. These will include sections on Chronic Kidney disease, cancer, population, and Long Term Neurological Conditions.</p>\n<p>Currently the data from the National End of Life Profiles has been recently updated at a Clinical Commissioning (CCG) level. The JSNA will be updated with Local Authority data when this becomes available. The postcode of usual place of residence was used to place each individual in an area by CCG and data relates to all deaths in England registered between 2010 and 2012 (inclusive).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Place of Death 2010-12: NHS North and West Reading CCG</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 548px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"Place of Death 2010-12: NHS North and West Reading CCG\" width=\"510\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Place of death</td>\n<td>Value</td>\n<td>ll</td>\n<td>ul</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>significance</td>\n<td>national</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hospital</td>\n<td>48.0</td>\n<td>44.4</td>\n<td>51.6</td>\n<td>349</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>49.31</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Home</td>\n<td>24.2</td>\n<td>21.2</td>\n<td>27.4</td>\n<td>176</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>22.16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Care home</td>\n<td>17.6</td>\n<td>15.0</td>\n<td>20.5</td>\n<td>128</td>\n<td>low</td>\n<td>20.74</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hospice</td>\n<td>7.4</td>\n<td>5.7</td>\n<td>9.5</td>\n<td>54</td>\n<td>high</td>\n<td>5.65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other places</td>\n<td>2.8</td>\n<td>1.9</td>\n<td>4.3</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>2.14</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Table number 2: Place of Death 2010-12: NHS North and West South Reading CCG</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 552px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"Place of Death 2010-12: NHS North and West South Reading CCG\" width=\"507\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Place of death</td>\n<td>Value</td>\n<td>ll</td>\n<td>ul</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>significance</td>\n<td>national</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hospital</td>\n<td>51.7</td>\n<td>48.0</td>\n<td>55.5</td>\n<td>351</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>49.31</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Home</td>\n<td>23.8</td>\n<td>20.8</td>\n<td>27.2</td>\n<td>162</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>22.16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Care home</td>\n<td>16.5</td>\n<td>13.9</td>\n<td>19.5</td>\n<td>112</td>\n<td>low</td>\n<td>20.74</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hospice</td>\n<td>5.0</td>\n<td>3.6</td>\n<td>6.9</td>\n<td>34</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>5.65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other places</td>\n<td>2.9</td>\n<td>1.9</td>\n<td>4.4</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>2.14</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: National End of Life Profiles (Public Health England)</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>The King&#8217;s Fund note that the place where people die has changed over the past century with most deaths occurring in hospital and not at home. In 1900 approximately 85% of people died in their own homes, by the mid twentieth century this decreased to around 50% and in the early twenty-first century acute hospitals have become the most common place of death.</p>\n<p>The NHS Berkshire End of Life Strategy was published in 2009. It should result in more deaths taking place within the usual place of residence and it includes the implementation of and ongoing utilisation of the Advanced Care Planning and Gold Standards Framework for the dying patient within primary, secondary and third sector organisations. It is intrinsically complex to predict those people who may be in their last year of life.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are a range of generalist and specialist palliative care services, provided by health and social care organisations and the voluntary sector that support patients and their families as they approach the terminal phase of their life limiting illness.</li>\n<li>The contact people have with services during the palliative stage of someone&#8217;s illness can be very infrequent depending on the nature and progressiveness of the disease/condition.</li>\n<li>There are a number of best practice tools and resources that are used to support the implementation of the Department of Health&#8217;s End of Life Care Strategy\n<ul>\n<li>Gold Standards Framework (GSF) is a framework of multiple tools, tasks and resources that can be adapted within GP practices and community nursing teams and care homes to improve end of life care for patients with end stage illness.</li>\n<li>Advanced Care Plans (ACP) is a document that individuals hold and take with them. They can be used to detail the individuals&#8217; thoughts about their care and the choices they would like to make (consider simplifying sentence). Individuals can initiate the ACP at any time, enabling any care staff to read about what matters to the individual, thereby facilitating continuity of care.</li>\n<li>The integration of the tools above, supported by well developed infrastructure, gives optimum best practice in end of life care.</li>\n<li>Advanced directives are legal documents, such as the living will, that will allow people to convey their decisions about end-of-life care ahead of time. They provide a way for patients to communicate their wishes to family, friends, and health care professionals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Holistic Services</h2>\n<p>The Reading Health  and Wellbeing Board has agreed for a Reading locality steering group to be set up, to look at how this important area of work can be communicated; to map local services within nationally recognised frameworks, namely; Gold Standard Framework, Ambitions for Palliative and End of Life Care <a href=\"http://endoflifecareambitions.org.uk/\">http://endoflifecareambitions.org.uk/</a></p>\n<p>This service includes adults, children and stillborn babies.</p>\n<p>The project is reviewing practical, spiritual and voluntary agency support available to the patient, next of kin and carers throughout the end of life journey to compliment the medical model. This is to ensure organisations are aware of each other&#8217;s services and effective communication links are in place. There are representatives from health, social care, funeral provider, mortuary, cemetery, voluntary, nursing home, carer, spiritual and public engagement working together to improve service delivery and socialise the end of life conversation.</p>\n<p>The key messages are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Break the Taboo:</strong> Encourage people to think ahead, share their preferences and talk openly about all aspects of dying.</li>\n<li><strong>Achieve a &#8216;Good&#8217; Death:</strong> Take a person-centred approach with the individual&#8217;s priorities guiding all decisions and actions.</li>\n<li><strong>A Holistic Approach:</strong> Provide care through integrated working, with professional collaboration to ensure timely, seamless support through a single point of contact.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Take account of the circumstances, needs and abilities of the person and their carers, with clear and sensitive communication.</li>\n<li><strong>Support for All:</strong> Value and understand everyone&#8217;s role, contribution and feelings, including support in bereavement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Berkshire West End of Life Project (Medical Model)</h2>\n<p>The End of Life (EOL) project seeks to meet the Ambitions for Palliative and End of Life Care: <a href=\"http://endoflifecareambitions.org.uk/\">A National Framework for Local action 2015-2020 published by the National Palliative and End of Life Care Partnership</a>. The project will ensure that patients who have been diagnosed as at end of life will be able to have the choice to be cared for and subsequently die in their preferred place. In doing so avoid unnecessary admissions to hospital for care that can and should be provided in their home of if preferred a hospice setting.</p>\n<p>The vision draws upon the wishes of those with experience and seeks to ensure a personalised experience of life that is as good as possible (consider simplifying sentence). The delivery of this vision and achieving the 6 ambitions is based on 8 foundations that underpin and are required to bring about improvement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personalised care planning &#8211; the opportunity for individuals to create their own individualised car plan, that expresses their preferences and set personal goals for the time they have left</li>\n<li>Shared records &#8211; ensuring the plan can guide a person centred approach, it is available to that person and can be reviewed and changed</li>\n<li>Evidence and information &#8211; the collection of national data that will inform judgements about the quality and accessibility of services, and support quality improvements.</li>\n<li>Involving, supporting and caring for those important to the dying person &#8211; providing care and support to families, friends, carers and all those who are important to the dying person</li>\n<li>Education and training &#8211; ensuring every professional working with end of life care patients, across the health and social care economy, is competent and up to date in the knowledge and practice that enable them to pay their part in good end of life care.</li>\n<li>24/7 access &#8211; every person at end of life should have access to 24/7 service as needed as a matter of course</li>\n<li>Co-design &#8211; the design of end of life care is best delivered in collaboration with people and professional who have experience of palliative and end of life care.</li>\n<li>Leadership -creating the circumstances in which action can be taken across the boundaries of CCG and Local authorities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>End of Life Hub</h2>\n<p>In the delivery of the End of Life Medical model, this service will be based at Wokingham Health Hub. The palliative care specialist nursing team will be managed by Sue Ryder, Palliative Care Team. The Hub is forecast to be operational by July 2016.</p>\n<p>The aims of the 24/7 specialist palliative care service is to:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support the whole community including care homes and other residential care facilities enabling equitable access.</li>\n<li>Deliver a service that is flexible and responsive to the needs of the patient, their families and carers.</li>\n<li>Provide face to face specialist palliative care assessment at the right time in the patient journey, including weekends and bank holidays.</li>\n<li>Provide care in line with the patient&#8217;s choices and preferences that will support patients, their families and carers to achieve the best quality of life.</li>\n<li>Provide support for colleagues through expert advice and joint patient visits where necessary.</li>\n<li>Reduce avoidable and inappropriate emergency attendances and admissions for palliative and end of life patients, through the delivery of good quality care in the community setting including timely symptom management.</li>\n<li>Promote care in their usual place of residence as an alternative for end of life patients through supporting patient discharge from hospital, including rapid discharge.</li>\n<li>Support the delivery of the training and education programme for end of life care.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the main components of care for any patient with palliative care needs is pain control. Presently any patient in Berkshire West who requires an adjustment to their prescription most often during a time critical event and often Out of Hours would require a community practitioner to obtain the prescription from a GP or Out of Hours Doctor and then obtain the drugs from the nearest pharmacy service. During which time the patients&#8217; pain remains uncontrolled.</p>\n<p>Improving anticipatory interventions as part of this project will enhance the quality of patient care community practitioners are able to deliver supporting timely symptom management, reducing likelihood of unnecessary crises leading to unscheduled hospital admissions. The provision of an anticipatory &#8216;Just in Case&#8217; medications bag will facilitate practitioners to deal with sudden deterioration in symptom control, ensuring common palliative symptoms are anticipated and appropriate medications are available in the patient&#8217;s home (including care/nursing homes) for Community Practitioners to immediately manage the patient&#8217;s condition. The provision of a &#8216;Just in Case Bag&#8217; will improve the level of care they can receive and support them to die in the place of their choice (their usual place of residence).</p>\n<p>The End of Life Care Hub will link directly with the appropriate support agency removing the requirement for patients to make multiple phone calls and using the expertise of the clinical staff to avoid unnecessary admission to hospital and improve quality of care. The provision of such a service appears key to enabling patients and their carers to achieve the end of life care they desire.</p>\n<p>There are also national learning modules as below provided by e-learning for Healthcare.  e-ELCA website: <a href=\"http://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/end-of-life-care\">http://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/end-of-life-care</a>.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Reading has a strong labour market, a high rate of employment and higher than average earnings, but census and other data suggest that areas with high deprivation and low qualifications and areas where there are a high number of residents not proficient in English are disproportionately affected by unemployment and low earnings.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>In 2014 Reading had a working age population of 109,000, equivalent to 67.8% of the total population. This is a slightly higher proportion than the rest of the South East (62.4%) and the rest of Great Britain (63.5%) (Office of National Statistics) population estimates, 2014, National Online Manpower Information System (NOMIS), Labour Market Profile &#8211; Reading), which is consistent with the younger profile of the population in Reading. (See population section).</p>\n<h2><em>What do we know about those in work?</em></h2>\n<p>Between October 2014 and September 2015, 85,600 people (76.3% of the population) were &#8216;economically active&#8217; (in work, seeking work or waiting to start work). This is comparable with the proportion for Great Britain in the same period (77.7%) and lower than the South East where the proportion was 80.3%. This difference may be attributed to the student population in Reading, which accounted for 38.3% of those who are economically inactive, compared to 26.4% in the South East and 26.2% in Great Britain. Overall, full time workers in Reading earn more than the average for all of Great Britain, but slightly less than the average for all full time workers in the South East. The discrepancy between male workers&#8217; and female workers&#8217; pay is lower in Reading than the rest of the South East. (In 2015, male workers earned slightly less than the average for male workers in the South East, but more than the total South East average; while women workers earned slightly more than the average for female workers in the South East, but slightly less than the total South East average.)</p>\n<p>Reading has a high ratio of total jobs to population &#8211; 1.0 (or a job for every working age person) compared to 0.83 in the South East and 0.8 in Great Britain (ONS Jobs Density 2013, NOMIS, Labour Market Profile &#8211; Reading, 2016). Most jobs in Reading in 2014 were in the provision of services (91,200, or 94.4%). Reading had a higher proportion of jobs in this industry than the South East and Great Britain (87.6% and 85.6%). Other significant sectors were: the provision of financial services (26,300, 27.2% &#8211; a slightly higher proportion than the South East (22.5%) and Great Britain (22.2%)); and public administration, education and health (22,300, 23.1% &#8211; a slightly lower proportion than in the South East (25.6%) and Great Britain (27.4%)) (ONS Business Register and Employment Survey, NOMIS, 2016).</p>\n<p>ONS annual population survey data indicates that 29.7% of Reading residents who were in work were employed in professional occupations, a higher proportion than in the South East (21.7%) or in Great Britain (19.7%). By contrast, a smaller proportion of Reading residents are employed in skilled trades (7.8%, compared to 10.1% in South East and 10.6% in Great Britain) and caring, leisure and other service occupations (7.5%, compared to 8.9% in the South East and 9.3% in Great Britain) (NOMIS, Labour Market Profile &#8211; Reading, 2016).</p>\n<p>Figure 1 demonstrates some variation in occupation by the area of residence, with those living in more affluent areas more likely to work in management and professional occupations and those living in more deprived areas more likely to work in caring, leisure, customer services and sales and operative and elementary occupations. ONS data also suggests differences in occupation according to ethnicity, with 68.2% of those employed in management and professional occupations reporting their ethnicity as White British, compared to 56.5% of those employed in operative or elementary occupations (Census, 2011).</p>\n<p>This suggests that, while those in work in Reading are more likely to be employed in a well-paid job than elsewhere, access to such jobs may be more difficult for already disadvantaged groups. Reading Borough Council&#8217;s Tackling Poverty Needs Analysis (2015) highlights that, although Reading has above average median earnings, the number of working households in poverty (in receipt of benefits and with an income less than 60% of median income) has increased. This follows a national trend, employment rising and real earnings falling between 2009 and 2014, resulting in slightly more than half of all children living in poverty living in a working family (Belfield, Cribb, Hood and Joyce) 2015; Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2015). Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (2015) also suggests that individuals from minority ethnic groups may be more likely to work in a low-paid occupation and their income is less likely to increase.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Occupation Group by Ward Deprivation Quartile</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4873/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Census 2011 (ONS Employed Population Count).</p>\n<h2>What do we know about those seeking work?</h2>\n<p>Between October 2014 and September 2015 an estimated 4,500 people were unemployed and looking for work (2,800 men and 1,600 women). 1,300 people claimed Job Seeker&#8217;s Allowance in December 2015. Of these, the majority (755) had claimed for 6 months or less. Around two thirds of claimants were aged 25-49 (800, 62%) and two thirds were male (805, 62%) (ONS Annual Population Survey, NOMIS, Labour Market Profile &#8211; Reading, 2016).</p>\n<p>Figure 2 demonstrates that the many of the wards with areas of greatest overall deprivation also have the highest proportions of unemployed residents. Some wards, particularly some geographically central wards (Battle, Minster, Abbey and Katesgrove) appear to have a higher proportion of unemployment than would be expected (Census, 2011). It is possible to see peaks in unemployment in wards where there are high numbers of households where English is not spoken as a main language, although the relationship is not straightforward (see Figure 3). This is consistent with Census Analysis findings that indicate that those not proficient in English had a lower rate of employment (ONS, 2014).</p>\n<p>Figure 2: % unemployed and seeking work by ward</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4874/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Census 2011</p>\n<p>Figure 3: Comparison of ward ranks by % unemployed and number of households where English is not spoken as main language</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4875/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Least deprived &#8211; Most deprived</p>\n<p>Source: Census 2011</p>\n<h2>Qualifications</h2>\n<p>In 2014, 45.7% of residents had the highest level of qualifications recorded (Higher National Diploma, Degree or Higher Degree), a higher proportion than across in the South East (39.1%) and Great Britain (36.0%). The lower proportion of residents with no qualifications in Reading is lower than for Great Britain (6% and 8.8% respectively), and similar with the proportion in the South East (5.6%). (ONS Annual Population Survey, NOMIS, Labour Market Profile &#8211; Reading, 2016).</p>\n<p>Again, although the level of education across the borough is generally high, analysis of residents&#8217; qualifications by ward demonstrates that those wards that include the areas of highest deprivation in the borough (Whitley, Norcot and Southcote. See deprivation by ward and Lower Super Output Area module) have the highest number of residents with no qualifications (Figure 4) (Census, 2011).</p>\n<p>Figure 4: % residents with no qualifications by ward</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4876/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Census 2011</p>\n<p>This suggests a complex picture. While unemployment appears to be linked to areas where there is high deprivation and a high proportion of residents with low qualifications, it may also be prevalent where qualifications are relatively high but where there are more residents without proficiency in English.</p>\n<h2>What do we know about those who not in work and not seeking work?</h2>\n<p>The largest proportion of those not seeking work in Reading were students (38.3%). As a university town it is not surprising that Reading has a higher proportion than either the South East or Great Britain (26.2% and 26.4% respectively). Reading has similar or lower proportions of people who looked after family or home, or were sick or retired.</p>\n<p>As elsewhere, women are less likely than men to be economically active &#8211; 70.9% of women compared to 81.5% of men were in work or seeking work. Women were much more likely to be &#8216;looking after home or family&#8217; than men (4,953 women, compared to 407 men in Reading in 2011) and more likely to be retired (10,437 women compared to 7,647 men) (ONS Annual Population Survey, NOMIS, Labour Market Profile &#8211; Reading, 2016).</p>\n<p>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council (RBC)&#8217;s Corporate Plan includes plans to ensure that young people in Reading have the skills and experience to meet the needs of business and support economic growth (RBC Corporate Plan, 2016-19).</p>\n<p>In addition, the Council&#8217;s &#8216;Tackling Poverty Strategy&#8217; (RBC, 2013) highlights unemployment and low income in some areas of the town and sets out commitments to provide opportunities for residents to develop desirable skills through volunteering and targeted interventions and to encourage and support employers to achieve living wage accreditation.</p>\n<p>The national Child Poverty Strategy (Department for Education, 2014) focuses on addressing the root causes of poverty, including unemployment, low earnings and educational failure.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Reading has high employment and high earnings, but those from more deprived areas may be disproportionately excluded from employment, especially from the higher paid professional jobs that comprise the largest section of the job market in Reading, or may earn a very low wage. While unemployment seems largely to be linked to areas of high deprivation and a higher proportion of residents with low qualifications, there also appears to be higher unemployment where residents are relatively highly qualified, but where there are higher numbers of residents without good proficiency in English.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Those in already deprived groups have less opportunity for well-paid employment and lower income, which is likely to have an impact on opportunity to lead a healthy and fulfilling life (Dahlgren and Whitehead, 1992).</p>\n<p>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</p>\n<p>The Council has already identified a need to ensure that residents, especially young people, have opportunity to develop skills that will enable them to find employment in Reading&#8217;s high earning job market. It is important to ensure that those living in the most deprived areas of the borough are supported and encouraged to take up these opportunities. There may also be a need to support some groups to improve their proficiency in speaking English to enable them to find well paid employment.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/population-change/\">Population Change</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/ethnicity/\">Ethnicity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/migration/\">Migration</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/deprivation-by-ward-and-lower-super-output-area/\">Deprivation by Ward and Lower Super Output Area</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Belfield, C, Cribb, J, Hood, A and Joyce, R.

Under the act, public sector organisations like Local Authorities have an obligation to take notice of the need to reduce inequalities that result from socioeconomic disadvantage (Equality Act, 2010). Reading has an ethnically diverse population and Reading Borough Council has a responsibility to ensure that no groups face disadvantage as a result of their ethnic identity.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The main and most reliable indicator of the ethnic background of residents within a local authority is the national census. The most recent Census information (2011) is shown in Table 1 and has been compared with the previous Census (2001) to illustrate population change in a ten year period.</p>\n<p>In 2011 the largest proportion of the population (66.9%) identified themselves as &#8216;White British&#8217;. This proportion had decreased from 86.8% in the previous census and was considerably lower than the national figure of 80.9%, suggesting greater diversity in Reading in recent years and in comparison with other local authority areas. Those identifying as &#8216;Other White&#8217; (encompassing a number of nationalities, including Polish) account for 7.9% of the population, an increase from 4.2% in the previous census. South Asian groups (Indian, Pakistani and Other Asian) accounted for 12.6% of all residents in 2011, an increase from 5.2% in 2001. The other increase of note is the proportion of people identifying themselves as Black African, which increased from 1.6% to 4.9%).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Ethnicity in Reading &#8211; Census data 2001 and 2011</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Ethnicity in Reading - Census data 2001 and 2011\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethnicity Group</td>\n<td>Reading 2001</td>\n<td>Reading 2011</td>\n<td>England 2011</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White British</td>\n<td>86.8%</td>\n<td>66.9%</td>\n<td>80.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other White</td>\n<td>4.2%</td>\n<td>7.9%</td>\n<td>4.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mixed</td>\n<td>2.4%</td>\n<td>3.9%</td>\n<td>2.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indian</td>\n<td>1.7%</td>\n<td>4.2%</td>\n<td>2.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pakistani</td>\n<td>2.7%</td>\n<td>4.5%</td>\n<td>2.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other Asian</td>\n<td>0.8%</td>\n<td>3.9%</td>\n<td>2.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black Caribbean</td>\n<td>2.2%</td>\n<td>2.1%</td>\n<td>1.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black African</td>\n<td>1.6%</td>\n<td>4.9%</td>\n<td>1.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black Other</td>\n<td>0.4%</td>\n<td>0.7%</td>\n<td>0.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chinese</td>\n<td>0.7%</td>\n<td>1.0%</td>\n<td>0.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other ethnic group</td>\n<td>0.7%</td>\n<td>0.9%</td>\n<td>1.0%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics, 2001 Census KS06. SASPAC Version 6. 2011 Table KS201EW</p>\n<p>The &#8216;Other White&#8217; category includes many different nationalities both from within the European Union (EU) and elsewhere in the world. The largest of these is Polish, with 3,495 people resident in Reading in 2011, or 2.3% of the population. 3,919 people who lived in Reading in 2011 were born in Poland. A further 890 people are classified as &#8216;White &#8211; Other Eastern European&#8217; (0.57% of the population) and may include those who identify as Hungarian, Lithuanian, Slovakian, Romanian and Bulgarian. 2,495 people identified as White &#8211; Western European (including 496 who identified themselves as Italian), equivalent to 1.6% of the population and 1,594 people identified as White &#8211; European Mixed (1% of the population).</p>\n<p>Indian and Pakistani residents accounted for 4.2% (6,514 people) and 4.5% (6,967 people) of Reading&#8217;s 2011 population respectively. 2,617 people identified as Asian &#8211; Nepalese, some 1.68% of the population. There is evidence of an increasing number of people migrating to the UK from Nepal following changes in legislation between 2007 and 2009 which granted greater residency and pension rights to former Ghurkha soldiers and their families (Office of National Statistics (ONS), 2013a). No further breakdown is available for those identifying themselves as Black/Black British &#8211; Black African in Reading. However, ONS analysis describes a large percentage increase in the number born in Nigeria migrating to the UK between 2001 and 2011, related to restoration of democracy in 1999, civil conflict and rapid population growth (ONS, 2013). Since Nigeria is one of the ten countries in which the highest number of non-UK born Reading residents were born, it seems likely that this may have contributed to this trend (RBC, 2012). It should be noted, however, that ONS also discusses large numbers of UK residents in the 2011 census who were born outside of the UK who migrated from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Somali and Ghana between 1991 and 2001 (ONS 2013), and may have moved to Reading in the intervening period.</p>\n<p>Changes to Reading&#8217;s population have been largely driven by international migration (see migration module). In the 2011 Census, the largest numbers of residents born outside of the UK were born in India, Poland and Pakistan, and these populations are clearly reflected in the ethnicity profile of the population described above.</p>\n<p>There are geographical variations in ethnic diversity across Reading with central areas having higher proportions people from ethnic minority groups.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Percentage of population who identify as White British by Ward</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4877/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics, Census 2011</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Percentage of White (British, Other) residents by ward (Census 2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4878/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Reading Borough Council and University of Reading, Census Statistics, Detailed Factsheets, 2012</p>\n<p>Analysis of the largest BME populations by ward suggests some trends across the Borough (See Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Figure 3: Analysis of BME populations by ward (Census 2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4879/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics, 2011 Census: Quick Statistics for wards and output areas in England and Wales</p>\n<p>Abbey, one of the two most central wards and the most diverse ward, had much larger proportion of British Indian/Indian residents than was seen in the rest of the borough (11.9% of those resident in the ward, 1,503 people &#8211; almost a quarter of all British Indian/Indian people living in Reading). Katesgrove had the second largest population (827 people, 6.5% of the ward population).</p>\n<p>Park ward (to the East of the town centre) had the largest number of British Pakistani/Pakistani and Nepalese residents (1,370 and 877 people respectively, 10.8% and 6.9% of those living in the ward). Abbey and Battle ward also had high numbers of British Pakistani/Pakistani and Nepalese residents (734 British Pakistani/Pakistani residents, 5.8% of the ward population in Abbey and 930, 7.4% of the ward population in Battle; 336 Nepalese residents in Abbey, 2.7% of the ward population, and 356, 2.8% of the ward population in Battle).</p>\n<p>Battle ward, part of the Oxford Road area to the West of the town centre and the second most diverse ward in the Borough, had the largest Polish population (761 people, 6% of those resident in the ward). Abbey and Katesgrove wards also had high proportions of Polish residents (434 people, 3.4% of the ward population in Abbey and 364 people, 2.9% of the ward population in Katesgrove), but much smaller numbers than in Battle ward.</p>\n<p>Battle also had a high proportion of African residents, although the number of residents (729, 5.8% of the ward population) was similar to the numbers in Minster (town centre &#8211; 720 people, 5.7% of the population), Redlands ( 611 people, 4.8% of the ward population) and Abbey (town centre, 604 people, 4.8% of the ward population).</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>The Equalities Act 2010 legally protects individuals from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. Under the act, public sector organisations like Local Authorities have an obligation to take notice of the need to reduce inequalities that result from socioeconomic disadvantage (Equality Act, 2010). Reading has an ethnically diverse population and Reading Borough Council has a responsibility to ensure that no groups face disadvantage as a result of their ethnic identity. Reading Borough Council refers to this obligation in its Equality Objectives (RBC, 2015) and describes the Local Authority&#8217;s ongoing commitment to celebrating and respecting diversity in Reading as a key to the Borough&#8217;s success. In addition, as part of their public health responsibilities, Local Authorities are required to consider wider factors that will impact on their communities&#8217; health and wellbeing (DH, 2013).</p>\n<p>The concept of &#8216;cultural competence&#8217;, initially developed in the 1980s in response to the growing recognition that cultural and linguistic barriers between healthcare providers and practitioners and service users could affect the quality and accessibility of healthcare, is a broad way of referring to techniques and approaches used by healthcare services to ensure equity of accessibility and effectiveness regardless of cultural background. These techniques may include reviewing organisational culture to ensure that cultural diversity is understood and respected; ensuring practitioners are aware of potential cultural differences and how these may affect dynamics in their interactions with patients and considering how barriers can be overcome; valuing diversity in the workplace; and encouraging practitioners to take an interest in their patient&#8217;s &#8216;world view&#8217; and experience (Cross et al, 1989; Truong, Paradies and Priest, 2014; Schouler-Ocak et al, 2015). Although the concept is widely observed in health services, it should be noted that the concept is loosely defined and evidence for effectiveness is moderate (Truong, Paradies and Priest, 2014).</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Reading has an increasingly diverse population with those from BME groups most likely to live in central areas of the borough. Significant groups for consideration are likely to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polish and other Eastern European nationalities &#8211; many are likely to be non-UK born economic migrants. By far the largest number of Polish residents were resident in Battle ward, with smaller but significant populations also in Abbey and Katesgrove wards.</li>\n<li>South Asian groups &#8211; large Indian and Pakistani populations and, since 2007, growing Nepalese population. Likely to encompass recent migrants (especially Nepalese residents), those resident for many years and those born in the UK. A high proportion of British Indian/Indian people were resident in Abbey ward in 2011, while the highest proportions of Pakistani and Nepalese residents lived in Park ward.</li>\n<li>African groups &#8211; Census data shows that the population has grown since 2001, but it is unclear whether this is related to migration to the UK or within the UK. The highest proportions of those who identify themselves as African in 2011 were in a number of wards central to the Borough.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Evidence suggests that differences in health status between some ethnic groups appear to be mainly related to socioeconomic inequality, rather because of ethnicity itself. The picture is complex, with ethnic origin, place of birth and norms and behaviours associated with particular cultures not consistently related to one another (Darlington, Norman, Ballas, and Exeter, 2015).</p>\n<p>Differences in self-reported health in the UK 2011 census data suggest that health differences between ethnicity groups across the UK are mainly related to the age profile of each group, with those with older populations tending to report worse health, while those with populations of working age reported better health (ONS, 2013b). The most significant outlier for this trend is the White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller group and this is considered to be likely to be connected to a transient lifestyle which may affect access to health care.</p>\n<p>In some instances, conditions may be associated with having lived abroad in areas where the condition is more common. Incidence of tuberculosis and HIV, for example, are much more common in people from certain minority ethnic groups or who are born in particular areas outside of the UK (NICE, 2016; 2014).</p>\n<p>One of the key factors in health and wellbeing status may be ability to access health services (Jayaweera, 2014), especially for recent immigrants. For example, research into Polish immigrants in the UK found a tendency to present to emergency departments for conditions that are usually treated in primary care settings (Leaman et al, 2006). This may suggest lack of cultural knowledge (e.g. not knowing how to register with a GP) or institutional or cultural barriers to health services (e.g. refused GP services).</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>As the population becomes more ethnically diverse, organisations will need to continue to be mindful of the need to provide culturally competent and culturally sensitive services to ensure that health services remain accessible and responsive to the people who need them (see population change module). As mentioned above, some migrant populations may have specific health needs that require specific targeted interventions. Further investigation is needed to determine where this is the case.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/population-change/\">Population Change</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/migration/\">Migration</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Cross, TL, Bazron, BJ, Dennis, KW, Isaacs, MR.

    "title": "Early Years Foundation stage attainment",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Local strategies for improving attainment at Foundation stage in Reading schools have been successful, especially for children eligible for free school meals and those from certain targeted ethnic groups, with overall results now better than the national average. However, attainment data should continue to be carefully monitored and scrutinised to ensure that improvements can be sustained in the future. Foundation Stage attainment in Reading appears to be more equitably distributed than elsewhere, with gaps in attainment between target groups smaller than the national average.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets out the key areas of learning and expected development for children from birth to age five. A summary of a child&#8217;s development, called the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP), comprising an assessment of attainment against key early learning milestones and a narrative about the child&#8217;s learning, is completed at the end of the academic year after the child turns five. Assessments are based on practitioners&#8217; observations of the child&#8217;s spontaneous and independent activity and play. The profile also provides aggregate information about children&#8217;s attainment that can be compared across different areas. This is important because children from poorer backgrounds are more at risk of poorer development at an early stage in life (Public Health Outcomes Framework, Indicator 1.021 &#8211; School Readiness, definition and supporting information; GOV.UK; Department for Education, 2014).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>The chart below (Figure 1) shows the improvements and percentages of children achieving a &#8216;good level of development&#8217; between 2013 and 2015 and demonstrates improving standards during 2014 and into 2015, both in comparison to previous years and in comparison to the national average. In 2015, 67.1% of pupils achieved a good level of development at the end of reception. This was a significant increase on 2013 figures, but the level of improvement was at a slower pace than the overall national picture. As a result, Reading&#8217;s figures were better than the national average in 2014, but are now similar to the national average of 66.3%. These data suggest that local strategies implemented in 2014 have been successful and will need to be continually monitored to see if the recent improvements continue to be sustained over time.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Good Level of Development (GLD), Early Years Foundation Stage Profile, 2013-2015</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5419/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a></p>\n<p>This pattern of local improvements implemented in 2014 and sustained into 2015 is replicated across the full range of indicators used to demonstrate attainment. Although overall attainment was better in Reading than the national average, some areas remain or fell slightly below national average. Table 1, below, shows attainment in Reading for the last three years (2013-2015) against all indicators and in comparison to the national average. Where some areas are consistently below the national average, more information may be needed to understand why schools in Reading have not achieved similar levels to other areas, including comparison with areas with similar levels of deprivation.</p>\n<h2>Table 1: EYFSP Attainment</h2>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"EYFSP Attainment\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5421/EYFSP-Attainment/image/EYFSP_Attainment.jpg\" alt=\"EYFSP Attainment \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">EYFSP Attainment</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Education Performance Indicators, Reading Borough Council.</p>\n<p>To ensure that improvements in GLD are equitable, attainment is also analysed against gender, pupil premium (children who receive free school meals &#8211; a proxy for economic disadvantage), special educational need (SEN) and ethnicity. Table 2 shows the percentage of children in Reading achieving GLD for the last three years (2013-2015) who fall into these categories and the gap between them and the rest of the population in comparison to the national average.</p>\n<h2>Table 2: GLD by gender, pupil premium, special educational needs and ethnicity</h2>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"GLD by gender, pupil premium, special educational needs and ethnicity\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5420/GLD-by-gender-pupil-premium-special-educational-needs-and-ethnicity/image/GLD_by_gender__pupil_premium__special_educational_needs_and_ethnicity.jpg\" alt=\"GLD by gender, pupil premium, special educational needs and ethnicity \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">GLD by gender, pupil premium, special educational needs and ethnicity</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Education Performance Indicators, Reading Borough Council.</p>\n<p>In Reading, as elsewhere, although there was an improvement for both boys and girls, the gap in attainment between genders persists: 74.4% of girls achieved a good level of development compared to 60% of boys. The gap is similar in Reading to the national average.</p>\n<p>53.8% of children eligible for free school meals (FSM) in Reading achieved a good level of development in 2015. This is slightly higher than 2014 figures and is similar to the national average of 51%. The gap between FSM pupils and non-FSM children was 15.9% points in Reading compared to 18% points nationally.</p>\n<p>23.4% of children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) achieved GLD in Reading, compared with 21% nationally. The gap in attainment between children with SEN and no SEN was also very similar to the national average.</p>\n<p>The Department for Education carried out an analysis of attainment at all stages of education in 2010 and identified certain ethnic groups that performed worse than average (Department for Children, Schools and Families, 2010). These groups have been combined and used as a proxy for analysing attainment amongst children who may be culturally and socially disadvantaged in relation to their ethnic heritage. In Reading, 65% of this group achieved GLD, compared to 60% nationally. The gap between those in the group and those who were not was less than the national average &#8211; 2.3% compared to 4.1% &#8211; suggesting that those ethnic groups are much closer to the average level of attainment than elsewhere in England.</p>\n<p>In all cases the gap between those with the characteristics analysed and the rest of the population did not vary as greatly as nationally, suggesting that the resources to support attainment in Reading may be more equitably available than elsewhere.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s Early Help Strategy for 2013-2016 placed an emphasis on improving the attainment of children eligible for free school meals and certain BME groups (Reading Borough Council, 2013) and strategies have been put in place to ensure that: schools with lower levels of attainment are able to learn from local best practice; children&#8217;s centres are able to offer a standard programme to support readiness for school; and Foundation Stage teachers have access to additional relevant training, including understanding the impact of social differences on access to economic, educational and environmental resources, and methods to address language delay.</p>\n<p>The 2012 Health and Social Care Act transfers responsibility for commissioning public health services for children and young people, particularly the Healthy Child Programme framework, to Local Authorities. While some elements of the framework, such as health visiting and school nursing, clearly require specialist, clinical knowledge and expertise, the programme encourages and supports integrated delivery between health and other Local Authority provision, including Children&#8217;s Centres and education settings. This could include joint assessments that take a holistic view of the child incorporating health protection (vaccinations, dental health, and healthy weight), emotional and physical development and readiness for learning and school (Public Health England, 2016)</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Local strategies for improving EYFS attainment in Reading schools have been successful, especially for children eligible for free school meals and those from certain targeted ethnic groups, but results should be monitored to ensure that improvements are sustained in the future and any underperformance investigated so that underlying issues can be understood. Foundation Stage attainment in Reading appears to be more equitably distributed than elsewhere, with gaps in attainment between target groups smaller than the national average.</p>\n<p>Future commissioning of the Healthy Child Programme by the Local Authority may present opportunities for improved integration between health and early years education settings.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/children-and-young-people/\">Children &amp; Young People</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Department for Education, 2015.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>A care pathway describes what a person&#8217;s journey of care should looks like; what care they should receive, when they should receive it and when they should be referred for additional care and support. The pathway will outline routine care which all people should receive, and there may be additional pathways which only some people will go through, in order to provide for any additional needs. Whatever the individual journey, the use of a care pathway should result in the same standard of care being provided to each individual.</p>\n<p>The antenatal care pathway (<a href=\"http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/antenatal-care\">NICE, 2016</a>) describes the journey of care which should be provided to all pregnant women. Additional pathways are outlined for women who have pre-existing health conditions, or more complicated pregnancies.</p>\n<p>The antenatal pathway is a key time for screening for, and prevention of, conditions in the unborn child which could lead to poor health outcomes. It is also essential to maximise the health of the mother in pregnancy, which, as a <a href=\"http://www.oxfordahsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stephen-Kennedy-Healthy-Mothers-Healthy-Babies.pdf\">recent global trial</a> has shown, is a key indicator of healthy birth outcomes for the child (<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/landia/PIIS2213-8587(14)70121-4.pdf\">Bhutta and Kennedy, 2014</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://cpd.screening.nhs.uk/timeline\">National Antenatal Screening Programme</a> provides a timeline for screening during pregnancy, which includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-conception eye screening for women with type 1 or 2 diabetes and again at 28 weeks;</li>\n<li>Midwives working within screening teams undertake blood tests to detect Sickle cell disease and Thalassaemia by 10 weeks;</li>\n<li>Blood tests and scans will be offered 12 weeks for trisomy conditions (covering Down&#8217;s, Edward&#8217;s and Patau&#8217;s Syndromes) &#8211; blood tests are not offered at 20 weeks;</li>\n<li>Screening for infectious disease, if declined at the beginning, should be offered again at 16 weeks</li>\n<li>Further screening of the new born child is done at 5 days of age and is recommended at days 5 &#8211; 8 (day 5 is best), as part of the newborn blood spot test;</li>\n<li>A physical examination within 72 hours of the birth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The maternity care that every woman should receive as part of the antenatal care pathway is listed in the maternity section. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-child-programme-pregnancy-and-the-first-5-years-of-life\">The Healthy Child Programme</a> is a programme of health and social care that should be received by all children age 0 to 5 years. It includes a detailed schedule for care during pregnancy. This schedule requires that the mother receives the following checks in pregnancy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A full health and social care assessment of needs, risks and choices by 12 weeks of pregnancy by a midwife or maternity healthcare professional;</li>\n<li>Notification to the child health programme team of prospective parents requiring additional early intervention and prevention;</li>\n<li>Routine antenatal care and screening for maternal infections, rubella susceptibility, blood disorders and foetal anomalies;</li>\n<li>Health and lifestyle advice to include diet, weight control, physical activity, smoking, stress in pregnancy, alcohol, drug intake, etc.;</li>\n<li>Distribution of <a href=\"http://www.publichealth.hscni.net/publications/pregnancy-book-0\">The Pregnancy Book</a> to first-time parents; access to written/online information about, and preparation for, childbirth and parenting; distribution of antenatal screening leaflet;</li>\n<li>Discussion on benefits of breastfeeding with prospective parents, and risks of not breastfeeding;</li>\n<li>Introduction to resources, including children&#8217;s centres, Family Information Services, primary healthcare teams, and benefits and housing advice;</li>\n<li>Support for families whose first language is not English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, preparation for parenthood should begin early in pregnancy and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information on services and choices, maternal/paternal rights and benefits, use of prescription drugs during pregnancy, dietary considerations, travel safety, maternal self-care, etc.</li>\n<li>Social support using group-based antenatal classes in community or healthcare settings that respond to the priorities of parents and cover:\n<ul>\n<li>the transition to parenthood (particularly for first-time parents); relationship issues and preparation for new roles and responsibilities; the parent-infant relationship; problem-solving skills (based on programmes such as Preparation for Parenting, First Steps in Parenting, One Plus One);</li>\n<li>the specific concerns of fathers, including advice about supporting their partner during pregnancy and labour, care of infants, emotional and practical preparation for fatherhood (particularly for first-time fathers);</li>\n<li>discussion on breastfeeding using interactive group work and/or peer support programmes; and standard health promotion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, extra support should be offered to vulnerable women at risk of having low birth weight babies. The Family Nurse Partnership offers additional support for young parents aged 19 or younger.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The Oxford Academic Health Sciences Network has identified two key areas for collaborative work: reducing stillbirths and preterm births</p>\n<p>The clinical projects underway include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal availability of screening results that can be used to screen for stillbirth</li>\n<li>Universal fibronectin usage in threatened preterm labour</li>\n<li>Universal prenatal diagnosis of placenta accrete (AIP)</li>\n<li>Automated image quality analysis for anomaly scanning</li>\n<li>Development of robotic remote ultrasound scanning</li>\n<li>Early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia</li>\n<li>Rationalisation of preterm labour services</li>\n<li>Screening for preterm labour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of prevention, the work of the <a href=\"http://fnp.nhs.uk/\">Family Nurse Partnership</a> helps to ensure good outcomes for vulnerable young women in pregnancy. Smoking cessation services are currently supporting pregnant women to quit smoking. However, they cannot currently validate the number of quitters, as they do not currently have access to carbon monoxide monitors in the hospital. These test a person&#8217;s breathe for carbon monoxide, which is present in tobacco smoke.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>Late access to screening and support in the antenatal pathway is a risk for poor birth outcomes and of being born before full term, alongside concealed pregnancies, which can highlight safeguarding concerns.</p>\n<p>NHS England collects data from maternity service providers about the number of women who have accessed maternity services by the recommended 12 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy. In order to do this, the service provider counts the number of pregnant women who access services within this timeframe and the number of pregnant women who access services at any point in time. This is then compared to the number of women who give birth six months later. This gives an estimation of the percentage of women who access services within the recommended timeframe. The data is broken down by service provider and by the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) with which the mother is registered for GP services. Recent data for Berkshire is consistently returning figures of near to or above 100% of mothers accessing services within the recommended timeframe. (Figures can be above 100%, as maternity data is taken from two quarters after the service access data and does not refer to the same cohort of women. Additionally, the mothers giving birth may be lower than the number of mothers having an assessment due to those having terminations, suffering miscarriage or transferring to another hospital. Mothers may also be double-counted if they choose to have assessments at more than one hospital.)</p>\n<p>Low birth weight (when a baby weighs less than 2,500g) is a key indicator of health inequalities. The Public Health Outcomes Framework reports the number of babies of at least 37 completed week&#8217;s gestation born at a low birth weight.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Low birth weight as a percentage of term babies</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4866/image1/image/image1_1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p><em>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework</em></p>\n<p><em>Table 1: Low birth weight as a percentage of term babies</em></p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table class=\"bluegeneral\" summary=\"Low birth weight as a percentage of term babies\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluetopleft\"></td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2005</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2006</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2007</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2008</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2009</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2010</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2011</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2012</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2013</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">2014</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopright\">2015</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Reading</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">4.6</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.3</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.3</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.0</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.4</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.4</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.0</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">South East</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.3</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.4</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.3</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.3</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.4</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.4</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">England</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.1</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.0</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.9</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.9</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.9</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.9</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2.9</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><em>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework</em></p>\n<p>The percentage rate of low birth weight in Reading (3.0%) was not significantly different to England (2.9%) in 2014, although the rate for the South East region was somewhat lower, at 2.4%. The rates for England and the South East region have remained fairly static since 2005 (see Figure 1 and Table 1 above). Over the last 10 years, the rates for Reading have fluctuated from a high of 4.6% in 2005 to a low of 2.4% in 2009. It is difficult to attribute these fluctuations to one particular issue, but lifestyle choices by pregnant women around diet, weight control, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, drug intake, etc. could all be a factor in contributing to low weight babies at delivery. The latest 3 years&#8217; worth of data show that Reading has been close to, or below, the England average, which is encouraging. Continued work with mothers to be, in terms of supporting them to lead healthier lifestyles during pregnancy, should help to reduce further the numbers of babies born with a low birth weight.</p>\n<p>A Thames Valley Still Birth Audit showed that for the 3 year period 2011-13 the average rates across the UK were around 4.9 per 1,000 births. In the South East region the rates were around 4.6 per 1,000 births. Rates have been further broken down by Clinical Commissioning Group area; for South Reading CCG, the rates were around 6.1 per 1,000 births and for North &amp; West Reading, the rates were around 3.9 per 1,000 births. Caution should be observed as the numbers used in the audit were small so may not be a reliable indicator of differences. Other risk factors for still birth and infant death include: maternal age, socioeconomic position, multiple birth, and influenza (NHS England, 2014).</p>\n<p>Stillbirth rates are highest for mothers aged under 20 or over 40. Smoking in pregnancy doubles the risk of stillbirth. Figure 2 below shows the latest annual trend data for Smoking Status at Time of Delivery (SSATOD). As shown, 7.4% of women in Reading were smoking at time of delivery in 2014/15. If we apply this to the number of women resident in Reading giving birth in 2014/15 (3,098), we can estimate that more than 200 of these women were smokers. Whilst England has shown a consistent downward trend since 2010/11, the trend in Reading has remained fairly static, with no significant reductions, over the same period.</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Percentage of mothers smoking at time of delivery (SATOD), England and Reading, 2010/11 to 2014/15</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4867/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></em></p>\n<p><em>Source: Health and Social Care Information Centre</em>.</p>\n<p>The chart above clearly shows that rates for Reading have consistently been lower than those for England, however, the gap is reducing. Action is needed locally to create a consistent downward trend, so that fewer pregnant women smoke during pregnancy, up to birth and beyond.</p>\n<p>Being overweight or obese may double the odds of stillbirth, and the risk increases as BMI increases. Similarly, multiple births tend to have lower birth-weights than singletons and are associated with a higher risk of stillbirth. There is also evidence that having flu during pregnancy may be associated with premature birth and smaller birth size and weight.</p>\n<p><strong>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</strong></p>\n<p>Current best practice is based on <a href=\"http://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/pregnancy-and-complex-social-factors\">NICE guidance CG110</a> (NICE, 2008) which describes the additional care needed for vulnerable women over and above the standard antenatal pathway, and <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg62\">NICE guidance on antenatal care CG62</a> (NICE, 2008).

This will make certain that the vital opportunity for screening and optimisation of a mother&#8217;s health during pregnancy is taken. It will provide opportunity for information sharing for all parents, and for specialist support to be given to those who need it.</p>\n<p>Key areas of work are centred on working collaboratively in order to reduce still births and preterm births. There are inequalities in the timeliness of accessing the antenatal care pathways, and the occurrence of babies being born with a low birth weight or being still born. Tackling these inequalities is key to ensuring that all women are offered the best standard of care and that their babies are offered the best start in life.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the key inequalities?</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg110\">NICE Guidance CG 110 (NICE, 2010)</a> for women who have complex social risk factors is clear; the vulnerabilities most commonly found with poor or delayed access to the antenatal pathway are in women who;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>speak English as a second language</li>\n<li>are substance misusers</li>\n<li>are new entrants or asylum seekers</li>\n<li>who are suffering from domestic abuse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are first time mothers under the age of 20 years.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There is as yet no widespread antenatal prevention programme in place or a consistent offer of cervical screening within our main hospital providers across the Thames Valley.</li>\n<li>There is a gap in population wide provision of healthy weight and smoking cessation advice to pregnant women specifically, although they can access existing general services which are currently available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/maternity/\">Maternity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/perinatal-mental-health/\">Perinatal Mental Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/infant-mortality/\">Infant Mortality</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/smoking-in-pregnancy/\">Smoking in Pregnancy</a></p>\n<h2><strong>References</strong></h2>\n<p>Bhutta, A, Kennedy, S.H, et al.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The misuse of both drugs and alcohol is an issue in Reading. Currently the main concern is the increase in local misuse which is growing year on year.</p>\n<p>In December 2015, a Drug and Alcohol Misuse Needs Assessment was written which quantifies the extent of misuse of alcohol and drugs in Reading; the effect this is likely to have on people and thus on health and social care and other services, and on prevention and early interventions and, the nature of current services and treatment demand for substance misuse; and what might be done to better meet identified needs.</p>\n<p>Although this is a summary of the findings, a full copy of the drug and alcohol needs assessment can be accessed via the following link: <a href=\"https://democracy.reading.gov.uk/Data/Health%20and%20Wellbeing%20Board/201601221400/Agenda/Item_15_Appendix.pdf\">https://democracy.reading.gov.uk/Data/Health%20and%20Wellbeing%20Board/201601221400/Agenda/Item_15_Appendix.pdf</a></p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Alcohol misuse, mainly in the adult population, is a far greater problem than drug use in Reading, as elsewhere. Principally, this is because of the sheer number of people who drink alcohol in our society (a very large majority) and the increasing proportion who do so in ways that risk injuring their health. Based on current guidelines, we estimate that at least some 30,000 Reading residents are drinking to hazardous levels and 4,500 are drinking to harmful levels. As these figures are based on national self-reported drinking levels, research shows that people significantly under-report their drinking, we can infer that people&#8217;s true drinking levels are even higher than this. It is noteworthy that Reading has high rates of alcohol-specific mortality and morbidity from chronic liver disease in both men and women.  These rates indicate a significant population who have been drinking heavily and persistently over the past 10-30 years. Liver disease is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity increasing in England with deaths reaching record levels having risen by 20% in the last decade.</p>\n<p>Whilst locally the numbers of drug-related admissions and drug-related deaths are proportionally smaller, what is clear is that drug misuse, particularly of opiates and crack cocaine, places an enormous strain on the families of drug users, including their children; can have a serious negative impact on the long-term health and well-being of family members; and that many drug misusers have a myriad of health and social problems which require interventions from a range of providers.</p>\n<p>The most commonly used drugs, such as cannabis, opiates and crack cocaine, are illegal, uncontrolled novel psychoactive substances (also known as &#8216;legal highs&#8217; and &#8216;club drugs&#8217;) are relatively easily available.</p>\n<p>Drug and, especially, alcohol misuse is a significant cause of both violent crime and acquisitive crime. Whilst we know that acquisitive crime, mainly associated with drug use, is declining, violent crimes and assaults (including domestic abuse) are increasing and are a significant factor in personal and family problems, often placing children at risk.</p>\n<p>Many young people receiving interventions for substance misuse have a range of vulnerabilities that require specialist support and intervention. Those in treatment often report being victims of domestic violence; having contracted a sexually transmitted infection; experiencing sexual exploitation; being more likely not to be in education, employment or training; and being increasingly likely to be in contact with the youth justice systems.</p>\n<p>More needs to be done to encourage and enable front-line personnel in education, health and social care, and across other relevant sectors, to sustainably raise awareness of the risks of drug and alcohol misuse and how to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Education, health and social care front-line personnel also need to be enabled and encouraged to do more to identify people at risk of misusing drugs and/or alcohol, to provide brief interventions, and to refer to appropriate services. It would be appropriate to extend this to other services too, which may come into contact with vulnerable adults and young people, such as housing and the police.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>Drug Strategy 2010 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/drug-strategy-2010\">Drug strategy 2010 &#8211; Publications &#8211; GOV.UK</a></p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Alcohol misuse is a much bigger issue in Reading than drug misuse: it affects far more people individually and has much wider societal impacts. Significant problems are related to both, but especially to alcohol misuse, and are getting bigger year-on-year in Reading, as elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The lives of most drug users and of a sizeable group of alcohol misusers are complex and often chaotic. A multidisciplinary approach that truly joins up the various different services provided (for example, general practice, A&amp;E, other hospital services, community services, specialist drug and alcohol services, social services and voluntary and community services) will enable benefit for them and their families and for society more generally.</p>\n<h2>What are the inequalities?</h2>\n<p>There is a need to develop services for people who use NSPs. Currently, there are only one or two specialist units in the country yet this is becoming an increasing problem. The scale of physical and mental health risk in using NSPs is not clear, and, for many, it may be that &#8216;recreational use&#8217; of these substances, and cannabis, is no more an issue that the &#8216;recreational use&#8217; of alcohol. However, it is important that, for &#8216;recreational&#8217; users of both drugs (such as cannabis and NSPs) and alcohol, there are services available to help those at risk of dependency and significant harm.</p>\n<p>Other inequalities highlighted in the Drug and Alcohol Needs Assessment are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>alcohol misuse &#8211; there are very many more people in Reading who could benefit from specialist treatment than are able to receive it under current arrangements; and</li>\n<li>prevention &#8211; there are many people in Reading with either (or both) &#8216;early&#8217; misuse of alcohol and drugs who could benefit from specialist intervention to help them avoid a decent into more damaging use of substances.</li>\n<li>ensures that all health and social care services, and those of the police and judicial system, work together more effectively so that people do not fall into gaps between services and so that it is simple to provide care between different agencies without the service user having to try to negotiate their way from one to another;</li>\n<li>provides services of all types in different locations to improve engagement and thus outcomes;</li>\n<li>enables and encourages front-line staff in all sectors, to do much more to identify people at risk of misusing drugs and/or alcohol and to provide brief interventions, and refer to appropriate services; and</li>\n<li>enables different policies and services and the enforcement of regulations, to take account of the cumulative impact of drug and alcohol misuse to enable greater benefit to people&#8217;s health and to the community more widely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Links to the other following section:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/liver-disease/\">Liver Disease</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/\">Children &amp; Adolescent Mental Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/crime/\">Crime</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Drug and Alcohol Needs Assessment &#8211; http://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4501/Item-15-Appendix/pdf/Item_15_Appendix.pdf</p>\n",

    "title": "Disability and Special Educational Needs Assessment",
    "content": "<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>\n<h3>What is meant by Disability and Special Educational Needs (SEN)</h3>\n<p>There are multiple definitions of disability and SEN used by different organisation with no common definition existing across education, health, and social care organisation. Furthermore, different definitions are used at a service level within the same organisation. All definitions of disability will contain a variety of thresholds at which assessors determine that the restriction on the child or young person&#8217;s individual involvement in life situations is sufficient enough to classify that child as disabled or as having special needs.</p>\n<p>Below are some of the definitions of disability and SEN commonly used in education, health, and social care;</p>\n<h4>The Children and Families Act (Children and Families Act, 2014)</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>A child or young person has special educational needs if he or she has a learning difficulty or disability which calls for special educational provision to be made for him or her.</li>\n<li>A child of compulsory school age or a young person has a learning difficulty or disability if he or she\n<ol>\n<li>has a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of others of the same age, or</li>\n<li>has a disability which prevents or hinders him or her from making use of facilities of a kind generally provided for others of the same age in mainstream schools or mainstream post-16 institutions.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A child under compulsory school age has a learning difficulty or disability if he or she is likely to be within subsection (2) when of compulsory school age (or would be likely, if no special educational provision were made).</li>\n<li>A child or young person does not have a learning difficulty or disability solely because the language (or form of language) in which he or she is or will be taught is different from a language (or form of language) which is or has been spoken at home.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>The Equality Act (The Equality Act, 2010)</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>A person (P) has a disability if—\n<ol>\n<li>P has a physical or mental impairment, and</li>\n<li>the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on P&#8217;s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A reference to a disabled person is a reference to a person who has a disability.</li>\n<li>In relation to the protected characteristic of disability—\n<ol>\n<li>a reference to a person who has a particular protected characteristic is a reference to a person who has a particular disability;</li>\n<li>a reference to persons who share a protected characteristic is a reference to persons who have the same disability.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>This Act (except Part 12 and section 190) applies in relation to a person who has had a disability as it applies in relation to a person who has the disability; accordingly (except in that Part and that section)\n<ol>\n<li>a reference (however expressed) to a person who has a disability includes a reference to a person who has had the disability, and</li>\n<li>a reference (however expressed) to a person who does not have a disability includes a reference to a person who has not had the disability.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A Minister of the Crown may issue guidance about matters to be taken into account in deciding any question for the purposes of subsection (1).</li>\n<li>Schedule 1 (disability: supplementary provision) has effect.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>The Children&#8217;s Act (Children Act, 2004)</h4>\n<p>A child is disabled if he is blind, deaf, or dumb, or suffers from a mental disorder of any kind, or is substantially and permanently handicapped by illness, injury, or congenital deformity or such disability as may be prescribed.</p>\n<h4>Definition of Disability (World Health Organisation, 2013)</h4>\n<p>Disability is an umbrella term covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An impairment is a problem in body function or structure</li>\n<li>An activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action</li>\n<li>A participation restriction is a problem experience by an individual in involvement in life situations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 1: relationship between special educational needs and disability\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5929/Figure-1-relationship-between-special-educational-needs-and-disability/image/Fig_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: relationship between special educational needs and disability \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 1: relationship between special educational needs and disability</span></span></p>\n<p>Figure 1 above illustrates the often overlapping relationship between SEN and disability. Many children and young people who have SEN may have a disability under the Equality Act 2010 which includes long-term health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and cancer. Children and young people with such conditions do not necessarily have SEN, but there is a significant overlap between disabled children and young people and those with SEN. Where a disabled child or young person requires special educational provision they will also be covered by the SEN definition (Department for Education and Department of Health, 2015).</p>\n<h3>Aims of needs assessment</h3>\n<p>The local Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) highlighted a need for robust and comprehensive analysis of disability and special educational needs in Reading. It was therefore decided by local commissioners in the local authority and the NHS to undertake a comprehensive needs assessment of disability and SEN for ages 0 to 25 years to inform future commissioning under the SEN/D reforms.</p>\n<p>The assessment aims to look at the available data and information about children with disabilities across Reading from local authority, education, and health data sources. In order to assess future need and provision the assessment considers trends in current prevalence and local demographics as well as the trends in the health and social determinants of disability and SEN. It combines this with nationally published statistics, research, policies, and strategies in order to develop a shared understanding of current and future need and priorities for children and young people with disabilities and SEN across health, education, and social care in Reading.</p>\n<h3>National picture of disability and SEN services</h3>\n<hr />\n<h4>Key changes to disability and SEN from Sep 2014</h4>\n<p>Covers children and young people from birth to the age 25</p>\n<p>Focus on including children, young people, and their parents in decision making</p>\n<p>Focus on high aspiration and an improvement of outcomes for children and young people</p>\n<p>Focus on supporting children and young people to succeed in their education and make a successful transition to adulthood</p>\n<p>Focus on the strengthening of joint planning and commissioning between education, health, and social care</p>\n<p>The replacement of Statements of SEN/Learning Difficulty Assessments (LDAs) with Education Health and Care (EHC) plans</p>\n<p>The need to provide and publish a local offer of services for children and young people with disability and SEN/D</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Children and Families Act (Children and Families Act, 2014) legislation which came into affect from the 1st September 2014 represented a change in how disability and SEN services will be defined and provided. This was followed by a new code of practice published in January 2015 (Department for Education and Department of Health, 2015) which give statutory guidance on the duties, policies and procedures relating to the new Act. This code of practice draws on the experience of pathfinder local authorities who have piloted new approaches within their communities (Department for Education, 2014). The key changes brought about by the Act and the Code of Practice can be seen in the box.</p>\n<p>The Code of Practice also supplies new guidance on; publishing and local offer of support, identifying and supporting student with SEN through a graduated approach in education and training settings; supporting children in who are in Youth Custody.</p>\n<p>By 1st April 2018, local authorities must have transferred all children and young people with SEN statements to the new system. To support the transition from the previous system to the new system a phased approach has been developed. It is important to note with regards to the changes from SEN Statements/LDAs to EHC plans that the legal test of eligibility remains the same and it is expected that all children and young people who, under the previous system, would continue to have a statement/LDA will be transferred to an EHC plan.</p>\n<p>Personal Budgets are an amount of money provided by the Local Authority to deliver the provision outlined in the individual EHC plan. There are three mechanisms for the delivery of a Personal Budget:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Direct payments where the individual receives the cash to contract, purchase and manage services themselves</li>\n<li>An arrangement whereby the local authority, school or college and the funds and commission the support specified in the plan</li>\n<li>Third party arrangement where funds are paid to and managed by an individual organisation on behalf of the child&#8217;s parent or the young person</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Determinants of disability and SEN</h3>\n<p>The main known determinants of disability and SEN can be split into two categories of health determinants and social determinants.</p>\n<h4>Health determinants of disability and SEN</h4>\n<h5>Prenatal and birth</h5>\n<h6>Infectious diseases</h6>\n<p>There are some infections that are known to cause problems during pregnancy and, although the chance of the mother catching these infections and/or the infections been passed to the unborn baby and causing problems are low, they can have some serious implications to maternal and child health (NHS Choices, 2015).</p>\n<p>Chickenpox in pregnancy can risk the unborn baby developing foetal varicella syndrome (FVS). This can cause eye defects, shortened limbs, and brain damage to the baby. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus in young children which can be caught during pregnancy via the spread of saliva and cause problems in unborn babies including hearing loss, loss of vision, learning disabilities and epilepsy. Developing rubella (German measles) in the first four moths of pregnancy can lead to birth defects and miscarriage. Toxoplasmosis can be caught by coming into contact with cat faeces or by eating foods contaminated by the toxoplasmosis-causing parasite. If passed to the baby, toxoplasmosis can in some cases lead to problems with vision and brain damage. Viruses such as HIV, Hepatitis B and syphilis can be passed on from an infected mother to their baby leading to acute and chronic ill health.</p>\n<h6>Smoking during pregnancy</h6>\n<p>The risks to the unborn baby of been exposed to smoke either directly from the mother smoking or the mother been exposed to second-hand smoke in the home have been well documented. The chemicals contained within the smoke are passed across the placenta to the baby. Nicotine also reduces blood flow to the placenta meaning that the baby may not grow as well as would normally be expected. Health problems identified as being associated with smoking during pregnancy include;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complications during labour</li>\n<li>Increased risk of miscarriage</li>\n<li>Premature birth</li>\n<li>Still birth</li>\n<li>Low-birth wright</li>\n<li>Sudden-unexpected-death in infancy</li>\n<li>Increase infant mortality risk (estimated at 40%)</li>\n<li>Respiratory tract infections in infancy</li>\n<li>Asthma in infancy</li>\n<li>Ear, nose and through problems in infancy</li>\n<li>Psychological problems in childhood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(NICE, 2010)</p>\n<h6>Drug and alcohol use during pregnancy</h6>\n<p>The UK Chief Medical Officer proposed new alcohol guidelines which include guidelines on alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Department of Health, 2016). A summary of these recommendations can be seen in the box. These recommendations are based on a review of a large amount of evidence about the levels and types of health harms that alcohol can cause depending on how much and how often people drink.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Proposed new guidance on pregnancy and drinking</h4>\n<p>Women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should not drink alcohol at all</p>\n<p>Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby with the risk increasing with the amount of alcohol being drunk</p>\n<p>Risks are likely to be low if a woman has drunk only a small amount of alcohol during pregnancy: this may be before she knew she was pregnant</p>\n<p>Women who find out they are pregnant after having drunk more than a small amount during early pregnancy, should avoid further drinking and be aware that it is unlikely in most cases that the baby will have been affected</p>\n<p>Women who are concerned about how much they have been drinking whilst pregnant should talk to their doctor or midwife</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is compelling evidence that drinking heavily during pregnancy can cause and serious condition called foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) which results in restricted growth, facial abnormalities, and learning and behavioural disorders. There is also evidence that drinking regularly or periods of heavier (binge) drinking can lead to a group of conditions which present as milder forms of FAS. Mothers drinking 1-2 units of alcohol a day are likelier to have babies with a low birth weight, babies born early, and small for gestational age babies than mothers who do not drink at all. As the evidence around drinking at low levels is complex with no robust evidence for its safety currently available the guidance takes a &#8216;precautionary&#8217; stance in recommending that women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy should not drink alcohol at all.</p>\n<p>Maternal substance misuse is known to affect the pregnancy and to have detrimental outcomes for the child. The substance a pregnant mother is misusing will be passed to the baby via the placenta and this exposure can affect the unborn baby in a number of ways depending on the substance been used, the frequency and quantity being use, and the stage of foetal development. Affects will likely be confounded by maternal infection, and poor maternal health and nutrition. As well as the direct effect of the exposure to the substance via the placenta on the unborn baby, maternal drug use can affect the parenting capacity of the mother and expose the child the risky environmental factors such as crime and poverty (Day &amp; Sanju, 2005).</p>\n<h6>Maternal diet</h6>\n<p>Maternal diet plays and key role in a babies development beginning with the diet the mother consumes whilst she is planning to become pregnant. There are elements of a mother&#8217;s diet which can offer benefits to the unborn child such as the use of certain supplements including vitamin D (NICE, 2014) and folic acid. Folic acid supplements reduce the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida (NICE, 2008) in which the spine does not develop properly leading to weakness or paralysis of the legs and incontinence.</p>\n<p>A lack of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with a lack of vitamin D in the baby which can lead to hypocalcaemic seizures, and impaired growth and bone development. There is also some emerging evidence of an association between maternal vitamin D levels and foetal lung development and childhood immune disorders (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2014).</p>\n<p>There are other elements of a mother&#8217;s diet which can have a negative effect on child development meaning that there are certain foods that women are advised to avoid or limit during pregnancy (NHS Choices, 2015). Obesity during pregnancy can increase the risk of a number of complications for the mother including gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and miscarriage. Babies born to obese mothers also face higher risk of foetal death, still birth, congenital abnormality, being large for gestational age, and being obese themselves in childhood and adulthood (NICE, 2010).</p>\n<h6>Maternal age</h6>\n<p>Both younger and older mothers are more likely to have babies who are born early and/or have a low birth weight. Younger mothers are more likely to engage in the behaviours described above that can be detrimental to theirs and their babies health such as smoking during pregnancy and are less likely to engage in the behaviours that have a positive effect on theirs and their babies health such as taking dietary supplements. They are also more likely to access antenatal services later on in pregnancy (Public Health England, Various). Older women are more prone to complications during pregnancy and delivery such as gestational diabetes, breech presentation, and delivery by caesarean section (Jolly, Sebire, Harris, Robinson, &amp; Regan, 2000). Children born to older women are also more prone to chromosomal abnormalities such as Downs Syndrome (NHS Choices, 2015).</p>\n<h6>Genetic conditions</h6>\n<p>A number of conditions associated with disability and SEN have a genetic cause: they are caused by a change in a person&#8217;s sequence of DNA that is present in an individual at birth (congenital conditions). Some of these are caused by genes that are carried by a child&#8217;s parents who may or may not be affected and are inherited by the child such as Sickle cell disease. Others occur when a genetic mutation occurs in a non-affected parent&#8217;s egg or sperm such as in the majority of cases of Downs Syndrome. Genetic conditions are more likely to occur in children whose parents are in inter-family relationships such as relationships between first cousins. Inter-family relationships are known to be more prevalent amongst people of South Asian and Middle Eastern heritage. Genetic mutations are also more common in children of older mother&#8217;s and those who are exposed to certain environmental risk factors.</p>\n<h6>Low birth weight and preterm birth</h6>\n<p>A number of the determinants outlined above have been described as leading to outcomes of babies being born with a low birth weight and/or being born early. These can be seen as short-term outcomes which in themselves can result in longer-term outcomes.</p>\n<p>Being born prematurely increases a baby&#8217;s chance of having cognitive and neuro-motor impairment (Larroque, Ancel, &amp; Marret, 2008); sight (Quiram &amp; Capone, 2007) and hearing (Jiang, Brosi, &amp; Wilkinson, 2001) problems; and behavioural and psychomotor problems (Founder-Hughes &amp; Cooke, 2003). The level of risk associated with these outcomes will vary greatly depending on how early the baby was born.</p>\n<p>The majority of children with a low birth weight will have normal outcomes. However, a low birth weight increased the chance of illness and neuro-developmental problems which increase as the birth weight decreases. Problems tend to relate to mild problems in cognition, attention, and neuro-motor functioning with long-term studies indicating that these affects remain apparent in adolescence (Hack, Klein, &amp; Taylor, 1995).</p>\n<h6>Injuries during birth</h6>\n<p>In extremely rare cases a child can suffer brain damage at birth resulting from a lack of oxygen which can result in disabling conditions such as cerebral palsy. This can also occur in babies who are born prematurely where there is an increased risk that the baby will develop bleeding in or around the brain (NHS Choices, 2015).</p>\n<h6>Access to antenatal care</h6>\n<p>Given the strong association between maternal health and care and child development all women should access maternity services for a full health and social care assessment of needs, risks and choices by 12 week and 6 days of pregnancy. This is to ensure personalised maternity care that will improve outcomes for mothers and babies.</p>\n<p>Starting on the antenatal care pathway (NICE) early in pregnancy will ensure that the mother is offered all of the elements of the NHS antenatal screening programme within the optimum timescales. This allows for earlier, more affective treatment, and provides the mother and her family with the opportunity to make informed decisions about her own and her baby&#8217;s health (Public Health England, 2016). For example, treatment of maternal HIV infection in pregnancy reduces the of the HIV infection being pass from mother to child from 1 in 4 to less than 1 in 200. The antenatal care pathway also provides the mother with access to a range of advice around having a healthy pregnancy which will support the growth and development of her baby. For example, taking 400 micrograms of folic acid each day from before pregnancy until the 13th week of pregnancy has been shown to reduce the risk of the baby having a neural tube defect (NICE, 2008).</p>\n<h5>Postnatal</h5>\n<h6>Infectious diseases in infancy</h6>\n<p>Worldwide, infections are among the leading cause of chronic, developmental disabilities in children. The wide availability of vaccinations to protect children against infectious disease in developed countries has greatly reduced the levels of disease, disability and death associated with illnesses such as meningitis and measles. However, cases of infectious disease that can lead to childhood disability still occur in children who have not been vaccinated.</p>\n<p>In the UK measles causes moderate to severe complications in around 1 in every 15 children with the virus. Amongst these, 1 in every 1,000 to 2,000 cases of measles results in encephalitis which can lead to permanent brain damage (Oxford Vaccine Group, 2016). Meningitis is cased by viral or bacterial infections with a number of vaccinations available which provide protection against many meningitis-causing bacterial infections. Children who develop bacterial meningitis can in some cases be left with serious long-term health problems including; hearing or vision loss; problems with memory and concentration; epilepsy; co-ordination, movement and balance problems; and loss of limbs (NHS Choices, 2016).</p>\n<h6>Injuries to children and young people</h6>\n<p>Unintentional injury is a leading cause of death among children and young people age 1 to 14 in England and Wales. Unintentional injury can affect and child or young person&#8217;s social and emotional wellbeing with some consequences been long-term disability (NICE, 2010).</p>\n<h4>Social determinants of disability and SEN</h4>\n<h6>Age</h6>\n<p>There is a lower prevalence of disability in younger children. This could be in part to the later manifestation of a range of conditions with some conditions becoming more activity limiting as the child gets older (Blackburn, Spencer, &amp; Read, 2010). It is also likely due to the high reliance on school Special Educational Needs (SEN) data as an estimate of childhood disability prevalence.</p>\n<h6>Gender</h6>\n<p>Most surveys show that proportionately more boys than girls have long-standing illness or disability (Association for Young People&#8217;s Health, 2015). Boys are two and a half times more likely to have statements of SEN at primary schools and nearly three times more likely to have statements at secondary schools compared to girls (Department for Education, 2014).</p>\n<h6>Ethnicity</h6>\n<p>There is some research to suggest that there are a slightly lower percentage of White disabled children than might be expected, and a higher percentage of minority ethnic groups (Thomas Conran Research Unit, 2008). However, poverty and social disadvantage appear to be a mediating factor in this relationship (Lombard, 2009).</p>\n<p>Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) children are more likely to be identified as having SEN than their peers and have the highest level of SEN than all ethnic minority groups. This may be a result of families lacking information or experiencing problems accessing appropriate healthcare (Department for Education, 2010).</p>\n<h6>Low income and poverty</h6>\n<p>There is clear evidence that children with disabilities a more likely to live in families with low incomes with households of disabled children from minority ethnic groups having particularly low median incomes (Blackburn, Spencer, &amp; Read, 2010). Though, as the authors of this particular research highlight, this does not imply a single-direction causal relationship between low income and disability. There is no conclusive evidence to indicate whether or not low income results directly in disability or whether disability results directly in low income. Furthermore, it is likely that there are multiple mediating factors influencing this observed relationship. What is clear is that children with disabilities and their families continue to face inequality and material disadvantage.</p>\n<h6>Children who have suffered abuse or neglect</h6>\n<p>Children who have suffered for abuse or neglect can often develop significant behavioural and emotional problems which persist long after they have been taken away from the abusive or neglectful environment (Amaya-Jackson, 2008). Long-term effects of abuse and neglect include emotional difficulties, mental health problems, poor physical health, behavioural problems, and learning difficulties and lower educational attainment (NSPCC). Neglect is particularly damaging in the first two to three years of life but can compromise development throughout childhood and adolescence and the longer that neglect continues, the worse the outcomes for the child. Children who have suffered from neglect show more evidence of delayed cognitive development, poor language skills, poor social skills, and poor coping abilities than children who have suffered other forms of mistreatment (Department for Education, 2014).</p>\n<h6>Looked after children</h6>\n<p>There is a higher prevalence of SEN amongst looked after children in comparison to their peers with most common type of SEN is behaviour, emotional and social difficulties (Department for Education, 2015). Four factors have been described as affecting the mental health of looked after children (Bazalgette, Rahilly, &amp; Trevelyan, 2015). These are;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Brain development: studies have shown both structural and functional difference in the brains of those who have suffered maltreatment</li>\n<li>Physiology: prolonged expose to stress can lead to a child having either chronically elevated or suppressed stress system leading to anxiety or aggressive behaviour respectively</li>\n<li>Genes: there is some evidence that early maltreatment can switch on genes that are associated with anti-social behaviour</li>\n<li>Differential susceptibility: describes how some children are more easily influenced by their environment than others</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Inequalities for children and young people with disabilities and SEN</h3>\n<h4>Physical health</h4>\n<p>A report by Public Health England determined that children and young people with learning disabilities are at an increased risk of exposure to the social determinants of poor mental and physical health such as poverty, poor housing, and a reduced social network (Public Health England, 2015). The report also found that children with learning disabilities are significantly less likely than their peers to be breast fed; significantly more likely to be exposed to tobacco smoke. They are also less likely to have access to timely, effective and appropriate healthcare. This leads to children with disabilities becoming more vulnerable to secondary health conditions which are less well managed and treated.</p>\n<h4>Emotional health and wellbeing</h4>\n<p>Although there is a large amount of evidence showing the strong relationship between physical and mental health, the nature and direction of the relationship is not always easy to define. Sometimes poor physical health leads to poor mental health and vice versa. Other times it is a single common factor leading to both poor mental health and poor physical health outcomes. Often the interplay between mental and physical health is complex.</p>\n<p>Children with a long term physical health problems are twice a likely to suffer from emotional problems and disrupted behaviours especially if the brain is affected by their physical health problem (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2012). Children with learning disabilities are less likely to have a close relationship with their mother.They are more likely to be exposed to inconsistent and harsh parenting and more chaotic family environments, more likely to be exposed to a greater number and wider range of potentially adverse life events, and more likely to have few friends, smaller social networks and receive less social support (Public Health England, 2015).</p>\n<p>A 2007 study (Emerson &amp; Hatton, 2007) found that 39% of 5 to 15 years olds with a learning disability have a diagnosable mental health problems compared to 8% of children who did not have a learning disability. They are also significantly more likely to have multiple disorders.</p>\n<p>Specifically children with learning disabilities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>33 times more likely to have an autistic spectrum disorder</li>\n<li>8 times more likely to have ADHD</li>\n<li>6 times more likely to have a conduct disorder</li>\n<li>4 times more likely to have an emotional disorder</li>\n<li>1.7 times more likely to have a depressive disorder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The study concluded that children with learning disabilities do not have an increased risk of mental health problems as a direct result of their disability but because of their increased chances of being exposed to poverty, social exclusion and more challenging family environments.</p>\n<p>The study also looked at the services and support received by children with learning disabilities and their carers. It found that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just 28% of carers sought advice from family and friend about their child&#8217;s emotional or behavioural difficulties</li>\n<li>56% reported receiving helpful support from services (75% received any support)</li>\n<li>There was no evidence that children with learning disabilities had less access to sources of support than children without learning disabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The gaps in support for children with learning disabilities and/or autism who have a mental health problem have recently been highlighted (Local Government Association and NHS England, 2015) as being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mental health problems are not being picked up or treated at an early stage in the community</li>\n<li>Poor care services and support packages lead to behaviours that can challenge services leading to placement breakdown or families who are unable to cope</li>\n<li>Evidence based interventions are not made available to minimise risky behaviour from a young age</li>\n<li>Young people going undiagnosed and struggling to access mainstream services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Too many people been in hospital for many years</p>\n<h4>Lifestyle behaviours</h4>\n<p>Measuring smoking rates, and alcohol and drug use is difficult as we are mainly reliant on self-report surveys based on a small sample of the population. There is a possibility that young people with disabilities may be exposed to alcohol and illegal drugs due to a number of factors namely: isolation, social pressure, mental health problems, poverty, communication difficulties and a lack of accessible information, and self-medication (Beddoes &amp; Sheikh, 2010). Similarly, given the association between smoking and low income (Office for National Statistics, 2014) and between disability and low income (Blackburn, Spencer, &amp; Read, 2010), young people with disability may be more likely to smoke than their peers.</p>\n<p>Data has shown and relationship between adult disability and obesity. This relationship will vary depending on the level and type of disability as well as by age and sex (Public Health England, 2013). Children with a limiting illness or disability have also been found to be at an increased risk of being obese or overweight particularly if they also have a learning disability (Child and Maternal Health Observatory, 2011).</p>\n<p>The annual active people survey for those aged 16 years and over found sports participation to be significantly lower amongst people with disabilities than non-disabled people across all ages: 8% of disabled people exercise three times or more a week compared to 20% of non-disabled people (Sport England, 2015).</p>\n<h4>Childcare</h4>\n<p>The availability of appropriate childcare options for children with disabilities is limited which often means that parents are forced out of work in order to look after their child. 25% of parents with disabled children are not accessing the free childcare offer with the reasons cited being, the provision cannot look after children safely; the staff are not properly trained; the provision is not inclusive. 25% of parents report being refused a place because of their child&#8217;s disability or SEN. Reasons that early years setting report for refusing a child a place include: the setting cannot meet the child&#8217;s additional needs; the child needs one to one care which is not affordable; the setting cannot manage the child&#8217;s behaviour (Council for disabled children, 2015).</p>\n<h4>Play opportunities</h4>\n<p>There is much evidence around the benefit of play on a child&#8217;s development particularly for children with disabilities and SEN with play often been used as a form of early intervention. Despite this, young children with disabilities are facing barriers to play opportunities in their local areas. Many parents of children with multiple needs are facing multiple barrier to accessing play settings including a lack of specialist support, additional costs, and their children being intentionally excluded (Sense, 2016).</p>\n<h4>Education, employment and training</h4>\n<p>28% of young people aged 19 years who have a disability are not in education, employment, and training (NEET) compared to 13% of 19 year olds who do not have a disability. 48% of 19 years olds with a disability have been NEET at some stage with 24% having been NEET at some stage for over a year (Delebarre, 2016). An analysis of the 2014 national SEN data (Department for Education, 2014) found that pupils with SEN were much more likely to be excluded or to be absent from school and their attainment at school was lower than their peers with there having been no reduction in this gap. Pupils with SEN who were also eligible for free school meals had lower attainment levels than pupils with SEN who were not eligible for free school meals and than children without SEN who were eligible for free school meals. 82% of pupils with a statement of SEN in 2014 went onto Further Education or training compared to 76% of pupils with SEN without statements and 89% of those without SEN. 52% of pupils with SEN in schools progressed to Higher Education compared to 63% of those without SEN.</p>\n<h4>Low income and poverty</h4>\n<p>Children and young people with disabilities and their families continue to face inequality and material disadvantage. There is clear evidence that children with disabilities a more likely to live in families with low incomes with households of disabled children from minority ethnic groups having particularly low median incomes (Blackburn, Spencer, &amp; Read, 2010). In 2014 with SEN were twice as likely to be in receipt of free school meals as children without SEN (Department for Education, 2014). Children and young people with learning disabilities are more likely to live in rented housing, overcrowded hosing, housing that is in a poor state of repair, and housing that is too cold in winter (Public Health England, 2015).</p>\n<h4>Youth offending</h4>\n<p>The Ministry of Justice: Transforming Youth Custody consultation (Ministry of Justice, 2013) reported that 18% of young people in custody who had received a sentence had a statement of SEN compared to 3% of the general population. It also reported evidence suggesting that the prevalence of neuro-development disorders among young people who are in custody is higher than the prevalence in the general population. Finally, it reported that over 60% of young people in the youth justice system have problems with speech, language or communication.</p>\n<h4>Abuse and neglect including sexual exploitation</h4>\n<p>Children and you people with disabilities are at a greater risk of all types of abuse including neglect than non-disabled children and young people. Research reported by the NSPCC suggests that children with behavioural problems are at the greatest risk of abuse (NSPCC, 2014). The same report highlighted evidence that boys with disabilities are at a greater risk of abuse than girls with disabilities and that children in residential care face particular risks. Children and young people with learning disabilities are at an increase risk of exposure to violence including bullying, physical, sexual, and emotional abuse (Public Health England, 2015). A report by Barnardos reveals that children and young people with learning disabilities are more vulnerable to child sexual exploitation than other children and that they are also facing additional barriers to protection and support (Franklin, Raws, &amp; Smeaton, 2015).</p>\n<h2>Facts, figures and trends (0-25)</h2>\n<h3>Population overview</h3>\n<h4>Population aged 0 to 25 &#8211; Reading</h4>\n<p>The 0 to 25 year old population of Reading can be seen in the table below projected over the next ten years (figures are in thousands).

The tool uses and builds upon data from both the Public Health and NHS outcomes Frameworks in order to allow local areas to measure the health and wellbeing of local children against national or regional averages.</p>\n<p>The health and wellbeing of children in Reading is generally comparable to the national average as measured across a range of key indicators. It is also comparable to the health and wellbeing of children living in local authorities experiencing similar levels of deprivation (Reading is in the fifth least deprived decile nationally). However, there are some notable exceptions. Areas where children in Reading are experiencing worse outcomes are centred on life expectancy at birth for males; school readiness; young people not in education, employment, or training; and coverage of childhood vaccination.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that these local authority level profiles will mask some significant variation and inequalities across different sub-groups of the population such as those living in areas of higher relative deprivation, and people from minority ethnic groups. Furthermore, we know that children and young people with disabilities risk poorer outcomes than the general population which will not be reflected in these figures.</p>\n<h3>Determinants of disability and SEN</h3>\n<p>The table below summaries local data related to the determinants of disability and SEN that were outlined previously. Trends are give where possible and the table to colour coded to indicate significant differences when compare to the England average.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Table 2: Determinants of disability and SEN - Reading\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5897/Table-2-Determinants-of-disability-and-SEN---Reading/image/Determinants_of_disability_and_SEN_-_Reading.png\" alt=\"Table 2: Determinants of disability and SEN - Reading \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Table 2: Determinants of disability and SEN &#8211; Reading</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Table 2: Determinants of disability and SEN - Reading (2)\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5898/Table-2-Determinants-of-disability-and-SEN---Reading-2/image/Determinants_of_disability_and_SEN_-_Reading_(2).png\" alt=\"Table 2: Determinants of disability and SEN - Reading (2) \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Table 2: Determinants of disability and SEN &#8211; Reading (2)</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Key to table\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5899/Key-to-table/image/Capture.PNG\" alt=\"Key to table \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Key to table</span></span></p>\n<p>Where comparisons can be made to England averages, it can be seen that Reading has a lower prevalence of the some of the major risk factors identified here as been related to disability and SEN. The exception to this being: births to older mothers; children living in poverty; children looked after due to abuse or neglect; and the rate of maternal rubella susceptibility: this means that a pregnant woman does not have the necessary antibodies in her blood to fight rubella (German measles). This will because she has not received a course of the rubella vaccination (part of the MMR vaccine).The MMR vaccination cannot be given in pregnancy so women need to be vaccinated prior to conception. Trends in some of the key risk factors are going in the right direction including maternal infectious disease; the prevalence of congenital abnormalities; dependent children living in poverty; and the rate of children being looked after. However, the number of children being looked after due to reasons of abuse or neglect is increasing over time.</p>\n<h3>Prevalence of disability and SEN</h3>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 5.1% of children worldwide have a disability with 0.7% having a severe disability (WHO, 2008).</p>\n<p>There is currently no universal system within the health and social care sector which records the number of children and young people with disabilities making it difficult to understand the overall level of local need and prevalence in terms of different types of disability and severity. A recent development which will help to overcome this gap in local knowledge is the development and implementation of the national Maternity and Children&#8217;s Dataset (The Health and Social Care Information Centre). The aim of the dataset is to &#8220;improve clinical quality and service efficiency; and to commission services in a way that improves health and reduces inequalities&#8221;. Providers have begun submitting data to the dataset though it may be some time until the data is fully available for use by commissioners.</p>\n<h4>Estimated prevalence of disability and SEN &#8211; Reading</h4>\n<p>A Needs Assessment report conducted by the National Child and Maternal Health Intelligence Network states:</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number of disabled children in England is estimated to be between 288,000 and 513,000 by the Thomas Coram Research Unit (TCRU). The mean percentage of disabled children in English local authorities has been estimated to be between 3.0 percent and 5.4 percent, through a survey of all Directors of Children&#8217;s Services in England undertaken by the TCRU. If applied to the population of Reading this would equate to between 968 and 1,742 children experiencing some form of disability.&#8221; http://atlas.chimat.org.uk/IAS/profiles/profile?profileId=46&amp;geoTypeId=</p>\n<p>The table below shows the results of studies into the prevalence of disability in children and young people by diagnosis.

The reasons for this discrepancy will include;</p>\n<h4>SEN/D prevalence in schools</h4>\n<p>Special Educational Needs data is often used as a proxy measure for overall disability prevalence amongst children and young people. The main collection of the school Census conducted in January each year in the widest and most comprehensive count of children with SEN/D.</p>\n<p>There are different categories of SEN/D within the education system which drive the categories included in the data collection. These are shown in the diagram below. The changes made in the SEN/D system has meant changes to how the data that is collected is categorised. This will have some implications in using the data to monitor trends which compare the data collected prior to September 2014 with the data collected under the current system.</p>\n<p>A child may have a SEN or disability which can be supported adequately within existing school resources (SEN support). Where this is not possible then the Local Authority is able to assess the child to develop EHC plan and will make provisions for additional resources to be made available to the school in order to meet the child&#8217;s needs. Therefore, having a statement (under the old system) or an EHC plan (under the current system) identifies children who have the highest levels of need.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 3: Categories of Special Educational Needs and Disability\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5901/Figure-3-Categories-of-Special-Educational-Needs-and-Disability/image/Categories_of_Special_Educational_Needs_and_Disability.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: Categories of Special Educational Needs and Disability \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 3: Categories of Special Educational Needs and Disability</span></span></p>\n<p>A child assessed as having SEN/D will be assessed as having one of the following types of SEN/D under the current SEN/D system.

It shows conditions affecting the heart, the respiratory system, the digestive system, and the urinary system. These conditions will have a broad range of short and long term effects on the life of the child and their families with some being relatively minor problems that can be corrected during infancy. Others will require long-term medical intervention and may result in a shortened life-span for the child. Numbers of babies affected by these conditions are low with heart defects been by far the most common congenital abnormality. The pattern of occurrence of these conditions has been one of some decrease followed by an increase in more recent years. This is likely representative of improvements in pre-natal diagnosis and advancements in neonatal and paediatric care which mean that the predicted outcomes for these children are much more positive than they once were.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Table 7: Congenital anomalies per 10,000 live births 1992 to 2012\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5909/Table-7-Congenital-anomalies-per-10000-live-births-1992-to-2012/image/Congenital_anomalies.png\" alt=\"Table 7: Congenital anomalies per 10,000 live births 1992 to 2012 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Table 7: Congenital anomalies per 10,000 live births 1992 to 2012</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Eurocat Network</p>\n<p>There is no single data source which can be easily accessed to show us the overall local prevalence of long term health conditions such as asthma, diabetes and epilepsy in children and young people. One place we can look for an indication of these numbers is at hospital admission data. This will not show us the total prevalence rate as we are only seeing those children who require emergency secondary care for the condition and is only a proxy measure used to compare local rates with those experienced nationally. There are around 200 per 100,000 children and young people under the age of 19 from North and West Reading CCG and 300 per 100,000 children from South Reading admitted to hospital for these conditions. This is a lower rate than the national average in the case of North and West Reading CCG and a comparable rate to the national average in the case of South Reading CCG. This reveals that either the prevalence of these conditions is lower in North and West Reading CCG or that the conditions are been better managed in the community and require less emergency intervention.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 5: Emergency admissions for diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5910/Figure-5-Emergency-admissions-for-diabetes-epilepsy-or-asthma/image/Emergency_admissions_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 5: Emergency admissions for diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 5: Emergency admissions for diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 5: Emergency admissions for diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma (2)\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5911/Figure-5-Emergency-admissions-for-diabetes-epilepsy-or-asthma-2/image/Emergency_admissions_2.png\" alt=\"Figure 5: Emergency admissions for diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma (2) \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 5: Emergency admissions for diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma (2)</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England</p>\n<h2>Current service provision</h2>\n<p>To ensure that children and young people with disabilities and SEN are able to reach their potential it is important that there is a provision of effective care and support provided at the appropriate stages of their life. This support comes from different agencies; health, education, social, and voluntary services. Some individuals will require low levels of support whilst others will require high levels of multiagency support across health, social services and education. Local education, social care, voluntary and health services which support children and young people with disabilities are mapped out below alongside figures of the number of children and young people supported by these services. We need to remain mindful of the fact that children and young people will often be seen by more than one agency/service and will be counted more than once within the data.</p>\n<h3>Education services</h3>\n<h5>Early years support</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Early Years Settings</li>\n<li>Children&#8217;s Centres</li>\n<li>Pre School Teacher Counsellor Service / Portage or equivalent</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Mainstream Schools</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Mainstream schools</li>\n<li>Mainstream schools with resourced units</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Special Schools</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintained special school placements</li>\n<li>Other special school placements</li>\n<li>PRUs, Home Education and other Alternative Provision</li>\n<li>Special School Outreach Service (if one exists in your area)</li>\n<li>Special school family support workers (if appropriate)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The table below looks at the type of establishment which pupils with SEN/D in Reading schools were placed in as of January 2015.

Figure 5 shows that 53% of these attendances were for women and 62% were for people aged 20 to 34. 70% of attendances from people with a recorded ethnicity were from a White ethnic background.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that sexual and reproductive health services in Berkshire are integrated, offering both GUM and SRH. Both types of service may be utilised by attendees in a single visit.</p>\n<p>In 2014, there were 3,127 attendances to Sexual and Reproductive Health Services from Reading residents. 94.1% of these attendances were at services in Berkshire and 87.6% were to the Royal Berkshire Hospital Sexual Health Department.</p>\n<p>The largest proportion of attendees were aged 20 to 24 (41.7%). Male attendees made up 5.1% of attendances, compared to 11.2% nationally (Public Health England, 2015: Reading Local Authority HIV, sexual and reproductive health epidemiology report).</p>\n<p>In 2014, an HIV test was offered at 60.9% of eligible attendances at GUM clinics by residents of Reading and where offered, an HIV test was carried out at 81.8% of these attendances. Nationally, an HIV test was offered at 80.1% of eligible attendances at GUM clinics with an uptake at 77.5% of these attendances (Public Health England, 2015: Reading Local Authority HIV, Sexual and Reproductive Health Epidemiology Report).</p>\n<h5>Drug and alcohol services &#8211; Reading</h5>\n<p>The figure below shows the number of females who are in drug or alcohol treatment in Reading. Caution needs to be taken when interpreting this data as it is looking at raw numbers and not the number of women in treatment as a proportion of the total who are misusing alcohol or drugs. Lower/higher numbers in treatment may either indicate lower/higher levels of need amongst the population or may indicate a lower/higher proportion of those who require treatment accessing the service that they need. Around 225 women from Reading were in drug or alcohol treatment during 2013/14. Numbers accessing drug treatment in Reading are higher than those accessing drug treatments.

The report concludes that outcome should not focus on not just the conditions and health&#8217;s broader determinants but also on the whole families experience of care.

Their recommendations focus on four key policy areas;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Careers education and guidance: needs to address particular challenges faced by young people with chronic health conditions. The current provision is limited and not widely promoted with a lack of specialist knowledge around the needs of young people with chronic conditions</li>\n<li>Work experience: the barriers to gaining real-world work experience are often greater for young people with chronic conditions</li>\n<li>Vocational education: There is a need to ensure that young people with chronic conditions are given the same opportunities to access apprenticeships as other young people and for uptake by young people with chronic conditions to be monitored</li>\n<li>Health-related initiatives: There is need to improve access to evidence-based employment services for young people (such as Individual Placement and Support). There needs to be greater recognition by health teams involved in the young person&#8217;s transition from child to adult health services of the importance of work, and the opportunities for support that are available. This should include the extension of Education, Health and Care plans to better incorporate employment, and the integration of employment into transition planning between child and adult mental health services.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Supporting looked-after children with communication needs (Department for Education, 2011):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-looked-after-children-with-communication-needs\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-looked-after-children-with-communication-needs</a></p>\n<p>This departmental advice is for local authorities and independent reviewing officers.

A number of these are modifiable through: public health interventions (e.g. stopping smoking in pregnancy, increasing the coverage of childhood immunisations); the provision of high quality antenatal care early in pregnancy; and early intervention from social care (e.g. reducing the number of children looked after due to abuse or neglect). Therefore, the opportunities for joint planning around disability and SEN occur early on in the life cycle before the birth of a child.</p>\n<p>There a multiple inequalities experienced by too many children and young people with disability and SEN. Although, there is limited local data around these and we are unable to measure local levels, we can assume from national research that children and young people with disability and SEN living in Reading will experience inequalities across:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical health outcomes</li>\n<li>Emotional health and wellbeing outcomes</li>\n<li>Lifestyle behaviours (particularly around participation in physical activity and obesity)</li>\n<li>Access to childcare</li>\n<li>Access to play opportunities</li>\n<li>Lack of opportunities to reach full potential in education, employment, and training</li>\n<li>Risk of youth offending</li>\n<li>Risk of abuse and neglect including sexual exploitation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All needs assessment should be grounded in an understanding of the local population at risk. The total estimated size of the 0-24 year old population of Reading is 55,300 and is expected to increase to 57,100 by 2025. When looking at the population structure of Reading we can see that the proportion of the population who are aged 0 to 19 is notably larger than the England average. The proportion of the population aged 20 to 24 is also significantly larger than the England average. So, in terms of overall numbers, and the proportion of the population, Reading has a large 0 to 25 year old population.</p>\n<p>The health and wellbeing of children in Reading is generally comparable to the national average as measured across a range of key indicators. Areas where children in Reading are experiencing worse outcomes are centred on life expectancy at birth for males, school readiness, young people who are NEET, and childhood vaccination coverage which have a particular relevance when discussing disability and SEN. There will be significant variation in health and wellbeing within different sub-groups of the population. We know that children and young people risk poorer outcomes than the general population which will not be reflected in these figures.</p>\n<p>Estimates of the number of children and young people with disabilities and SEN in Reading range from 968 to almost 8,000 depending on the breadth of the criteria of disability been used. Nationally, language disorders and dyspraxia or other developmental co-ordination disorders have the highest rate of prevalence of diagnosis.</p>\n<p>There were 642 children in Reading with EHC plans in January 2015 with the percentage of children with a plan as a proportion of all children been similar to the England average. This figure is close to the estimated total prevalence of children with more severe disability. 3,149 children in Reading were receiving SEN support in January 2015 with the percentage of children receiving support as a proportion of all children been marginally higher than the national average. The total of children on EHC plans plus those receiving SEN support brings us closer to the estimated total prevalence of disability when using a broader definition.</p>\n<p>The most common categories of need for children with SEN in Reading are social, emotional, and metal health; and speech, language, and communication needs: the proportion of children with a these primary needs is significantly higher than the England average.</p>\n<p>In terms of local service use, the key findings of this needs assessment are summarised below;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>61% of people attending sexual health clinics were offered a HIV test compared to 80% nationally</li>\n<li>203 pregnant women in Reading are estimated to be smokers compared to 26 who attempted to quit through local stop smoking services</li>\n<li>Over 90% of women seen by Royal Berkshire Maternity service are seen by 90 days of pregnancy</li>\n<li>The Royal Berkshire Hospital falls just below the acceptable target for foetal anomaly screening coverage</li>\n<li>Number of antenatal visits by health visitors are historically low due to targeting of this contact to higher-risk mums</li>\n<li>Childhood immunisation coverage target not been consistently met</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Predicted change in levels of needs</h2>\n<p>In order to consider the future numbers of children and young people with disability and SEN and the types of needs they may have the following factors discussed in this needs assessment so far have been considered: current trends in prevalence; projected changes in population size; and trends in the determinants of disability and SEN.</p>\n<p>Although the total 0 to 24 year old population of Reading is projected to increase by only 3% by 2025 (a net increase of 1,800 children and young people), some age groups within the 0 to 24 year old population are expected to see a much higher percentage increase than others. The 10 to 19 year old population is expected to see a 3,500 net increase with the 0 to 9 year old population expected to see a 1,300 net decrease. This indicates a shift in the age structure of the population and a likely shift in the age structure of the population of children and young people with disability and SEN: we are going to see an older population of children and young people with disability and SEN then seen currently. This could potentially see a shift in the level of demand on particular disability and SEN services (for example, transition and employment services).</p>\n<p>When looking at the available data on some of the key determinants of disability, the rate of rubella susceptibility in pregnant women, and the rate of children being looked after due to reasons of abuse or neglect is increasing over time in Reading. The size nature of the impact of this on the number of children and young people with disability and SEN in the local area is difficult to predict but represents an opportunity for early prevention and intervention.</p>\n<p>The percentage of children with EHC plans/statements in Reading has remained fairly stable in recent years between 2013 and 2015. The percentage of children receiving SEN support is decreasing steadily over time. This indicates that the levels of need will become proportionally higher at the more severe end of the spectrum of disability.</p>\n<p>We know that nationally more premature babies are surviving but the pattern of neonatal morbidity and the proportion of survivors affected remains unchanged (Costeloe, Hennessy, &amp; Haider, 2012). The possible impact of this is an increase in the number of children who have long term health and disabilities in need of specialist support.</p>\n<h2>Unmet service needs and gaps</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Vaccination coverage in childhood and in women planning a pregnancy</li>\n<li>Children been looked after due to abuse or neglect</li>\n<li>Uptake of HIV testing in sexual health clinics</li>\n<li>Pregnant women been supported to stop smoking</li>\n<li>Foetal anomaly screening coverage at the Royal Berkshire Hospital</li>\n<li>Antenatal health visiting contacts</li>\n<li>Early years foundation support &#8211; lack of access to childcare for disabled children</li>\n<li>Opportunities for play and physical activity</li>\n<li>Emotional health needs of children and young people with disabilities and SEN and their families</li>\n<li>Young people remaining in education or employment destinations</li>\n<li>Lack of local data on the outcomes and inequalities for children and young people with disability and SEN</li>\n<li>Increasing age of disability and SEN population and the potential shift in service demand (i.e. transition services)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Recommendations for consideration</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevention</li>\n<li>Early identification</li>\n<li>Service delivery and access</li>\n<li>Transition between life stages</li>\n<li>Supporting young people in preparing for adulthood</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further analysis and monitoring</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>There should be a shared agreement across health, education, and social care on the strategic outcomes which should be developed into a basket of key performance indicators (KPIs) that are regularly monitored and reviewed</li>\n<li>A joint awareness of the guidance and good practice such as that included in this needs assessment should be maintained and reviewed</li>\n<li>The views of children, young, people and their parents/carers should be included in any future needs assessment analysis</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "title": "Diabetes",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Diabetes is a long-term condition that affects an increasing number of people and is known in the majority of cases to be related to poor diet, excess weight and obesity, and too little physical activity. The condition is related to reduced day-to-day health and wellbeing and significantly increases risk of a range of serious complications and premature death. The increasing number of people diagnosed with diabetes has implications for demand for both health and social care services and interventions are needed to target those at risk of developing diabetes and those with diabetes who may go on to develop related conditions.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Diabetes mellitus (commonly known as diabetes) occurs when the body becomes unable to use insulin effectively. Insulin is the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar (glucose) levels by controlling the flow of glucose into the cells of the body.</p>\n<p>There are two types of diabetes mellitus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>type -1 </strong>diabetes (about 10% of people with diabetes have type-1), usually diagnosed in childhood or young adulthood, is caused by the failure of the pancreas to secrete insulin (the hormone which allows the body&#8217;s cells to use glucose) and nearly always has to be treated with insulin injections. In most cases, the cause of type-1 diabetes is unknown. This type of diabetes is not related to diet nor weight</li>\n<li><strong>type-2 </strong>diabetes (about 90% of people with diabetes have type-2), occurs when the body cannot make enough insulin or when the insulin it does make does not work effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Being overweight or obese is the main modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Obese adults are five times as likely to be diagnosed as adults of a healthy weight. Rising prevalence of obesity has led, and is expected to continue to lead, to a rise in the prevalence of type-2 diabetes (Public Health England (PHE, 2014); World Health Organisation (WHO), 2015).</p>\n<p>Longer term complications arising from diabetes include: higher risk of heart attack and stroke; neuropathy (nerve damage) in the feet, increasing the chance of foot ulcers and infection, sometimes leading to the need for amputation; diabetic retinopathy (long-term damage to small blood vessels in the retina -the leading cause of sight loss in people of working age in the UK); kidney failure; and depression. Diabetes is associated with lower life expectancy and is a major cause of mortality in the UK and elsewhere. (PHE, 2014; WHO, 2015).</p>\n<h2>Prevalence of diabetes in Reading</h2>\n<p>Currently, around 5% of people registered with GP practices in Reading have received a diagnosis of diabetes (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2015; Public Health England (PHOF), 2015), compared to 6.4% in all of England and 6.5% in local authority areas with similar levels of deprivation to Reading (the &#8216;fifth less deprived&#8217; deprivation decile). Prevalence in Reading is rising and is expected to continue to rise. Figure 1 shows the estimated prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in Reading and England from 2012 through to 2030.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 1: Estimated diagnosed and undiagnosed prevalence of diabetes in Reading and England 2012-2030\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5071/Figure-1-Estimated-diagnosed-and-undiagnosed-prevalence-of-diabetes-in-Reading-and-England-2012-2030/image/diabetes_figure_1_table.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Estimated diagnosed and undiagnosed prevalence of diabetes in Reading and England 2012-2030 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 1: Estimated diagnosed and undiagnosed prevalence of diabetes in Reading and England 2012-2030</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: National Cardiovascular Intelligence Network (NCVIN) (2012). Diabetes Prevalence Model for Local Authorities in England PDFs. PHE, London.</p>\n<p>This has implications both for people&#8217;s health and for health and social care services. There are substantial estimated total costs associated with diabetes, encompassing treatment, loss of productivity, and adult social care and these can be expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades (PHE, 2014).</p>\n<h2>Prevention of diabetes in Reading</h2>\n<p>Obesity levels in adults and children and levels of physical activity in Reading are broadly in line with the national average. However, obesity levels nationally have increased steadily over the last 20 years and only 67% of men and 55% of women in England and Wales report that they meet the recommended weekly amount of physical activity (PHE (PHOF), 2016, data from the Active People Survey, and see Obesity &#8211; adult and child and Physical Activity sections).</p>\n<p>We need to support residents to manage their own lifestyles to ensure healthy weights and active lifestyles in a variety of settings through supporting active transport, accessible leisure services.</p>\n<h2>Management and Treatment in Reading</h2>\n<p>A number of measures are used by PHE to monitor how well diabetes is managed in local areas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good blood sugar control in people with diabetes &#8211; patients with diabetes in whom last measurement of blood glucose was within recommended limits;</li>\n<li>Good blood pressure control in people with diabetes &#8211; patients with diabetes in whom last measurement of blood pressure was within recommended limits;</li>\n<li>Good cholesterol control in people with diabetes &#8211; patients with diabetes in whom last measured total cholesterol is within recommended limits; and</li>\n<li>People with diabetes meeting treatment targets &#8211; patients with diabetes meeting all three of the targets above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2012-13 (the most recent year reported by PHE), 34.9% of patients with diabetes met all three targets, slightly below the England average of 36% and an average of 35.9% amongst local authorities with similar levels of deprivation (the fifth less deprived decile). While the percentage of patients with diabetes with good blood pressure and cholesterol control were better or similar to the England average, the percentage with good blood sugar control was significantly below the England and local authority areas with similar levels of deprivation- 58.8% in Reading, compared to 74.9% in England and 65.1% in similar local authorities. This pattern is replicated in both CCGs that operate in Reading (South Reading CCG and North and West Reading CCG).</p>\n<h2>National and Local Strategies (Current best practice)</h2>\n<p>Diabetes is a largely preventable disease and the risk of further complications can also be reduced through lifestyle change &#8211; especially diet, weight management and increasing physical activity (NHS Choices, 2016).</p>\n<p>Obesity, linked with type-2 diabetes, is a national priority. The Government&#8217;s &#8216;Call to Action&#8217; on obesity was published in 2011 and sets out national ambitions relating to excess weight in adults, which it recognises as a major determinant of premature mortality and avoidable ill health (HM Government, 2011).</p>\n<p>The 13 quality statements of the &#8216;Diabetes in adults quality standard&#8217; (NICE, 2011) were informed by a range of NICE clinical guidelines and the &#8216;National Service Framework for Diabetes&#8217; that covered all aspects of diabetes care and prevention. Specifically, it is expected that the high quality care set out in this quality standard will reduce the complications associated with diabetes. NICE guidelines for diabetes include these for children and young people: pregnancy, type-1 diabetes, prevention of type-2 diabetes, risk identification and interventions for individuals at high risk. All aim to improve the prevention, identification and management of those people at risk of developing diabetes and those with the condition.</p>\n<p>NICE guidelines on management of type-2 diabetes, the most prevalent and the most preventable form of the disease, recommend an individualised approach to treatment, structured education aimed at developing attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about lifestyle choices, delivered at the time of diagnosis with annual reinforcement, dietary advice and blood pressure management.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Diabetes significantly affects the day-to-day lives of those affected and puts them at considerably increased risk of developing a range of serious conditions and of premature death. Diabetes type 2 itself and related conditions are largely preventable through diet, weight management and increased physical activity.</p>\n<p>While the proportion of people who are overweight or obese and the levels of physical activity in Reading are similar to the national averages, this must be seen in a national context of dangerous increases in the number who are overweight or obese, and declines in self-reported physical activity.</p>\n<p>Although management of diabetes in Reading is similar to the average, management of blood sugar levels is significantly worse than elsewhere. This suggests that more could be done to prevent the development of complications in those who have been diagnosed.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Deprivation is closely linked to the risk of both obesity and type-2 diabetes. Prevalence of type-2 diabetes is 40% more common amongst people from the most deprived areas compared to the least deprived areas. In addition, people from some black and minority ethnic groups may be more likely to develop type-2 diabetes at a lower body weight than people from white ethnic groups (PHE, 2014).</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/service gaps?</h2>\n<p>As well as population-wide interventions to encourage healthy diet, weight management and physical activity (primary prevention), there is some evidence that more could be done locally to target interventions at those at risk of developing diabetes (secondary prevention) and those who have been diagnosed and need support to manage their condition to prevent development of related conditions (tertiary prevention). Both NHS and local authority commissioners should consider how they can encourage and support lifestyle changes and substantially increase the number of people who are helped to reduce their risk of developing diabetes, and, for those who are diagnosed with diabetes, substantially reduce the risk of developing complications. Reading is now a part of the diabetes prevention pilot and this should be actively promoted to address the known risk factors</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity &#8211; adult &amp; child</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/physical-activity/\">Physical Activity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/common-causes-of-death-and-disability/\">Common causes of death &amp; disability</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>HM Government (2011). <em>Healthy Lives, Healthy People: a call to action on obesity in England</em>.

    "title": "Deprivation by ward and Lower Super Output Area",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are used by local authorities and other bodies to understand patterns of deprivation as they occur throughout a larger area.</p>\n<p>Whilst Reading benefits from high employment and high earnings, there are some areas in the borough that are experiencing high and rising levels of deprivation. Between the 2001 census and the most recent census in 2011, two areas in South Reading (the far south of Whitley ward and to the south of Northumberland Avenue in Church ward) fell into the 10% most deprived areas in England. The most recent IMD data was produced in late 2015.</p>\n<p>Lower Super Output Areas are a geography for the collection and publication of small area statistics (LSOAs). They have an average of 1,500 residents each, who experience similar social and economic conditions (DCLG, 2015). IMD scores by ward and (LSOA) in the Reading borough suggest a number of small areas of high deprivation where household incomes, employment and qualifications are low. In other deprived areas, mainly around the town centre, high deprivation is linked with a high rate of crime and a poor living environment.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) combines scores across seven domains to produce an overall relative measure of deprivation, which ranks small areas in England from 1st most deprived area to 32,844th least deprived area. Lower Super Output Areas are a geography for the collection and publication of small area statistics (LSOAs). They have an average of 1,500 residents each, who experience similar social and economic conditions (DCLG, 2015). The domains are combined using the following weighting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Income deprivation (measures the proportion of the population experiencing deprivation linked to low income) &#8211; 22.5%</li>\n<li>Employment deprivation (measures the proportion of working age population who are involuntarily excluded from work) &#8211; 22.5%</li>\n<li>Education, Skills and Training deprivation (measures the lack of attainment and skills in the local population in two subdomains: a) adults and b) young people) &#8211; 13.5%</li>\n<li>Health deprivation and Disability (measure the risk of premature death and impairment of quality of life through poor physical or mental health) &#8211; 13.5%</li>\n<li>Crime (measures the risk of personal and material victimisation) &#8211; 9.3%</li>\n<li>Barriers to housing and services (measures the physical and financial accessibility of housing and local services in two subdomains: a) geographical barriers and b) wider barriers such as affordability and homelessness) &#8211; 9.3%</li>\n<li>Living Environment deprivation (measures the quality of the local environment in two subdomains a) quality of housing and b) air quality and road traffic accidents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mapping IMD on to wards (see Figure 1) suggests a concentration of low deprivation in the north of the borough (Mapledurham, Thames and Peppard wards) and high deprivation in central and southern areas (Norcot, Battle and Abbey wards in the centre and Whitley and Church wards in the south.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: IMD 2015 by ward</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4997/image1/image/image1.jpeg\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office of National Statistics, IMD 2015</p>\n<p>The same broad pattern is observable when IMD are mapped on to LSOAs, but in this case it is possible to see the areas within wider ward areas that are most deprived.</p>\n<p>In particular, high levels of deprivation are clustered around South Whitley and the Northumberland Avenue area in the south of the borough, throughout Abbey ward in the town centre, and in specific neighbourhoods in the otherwise affluent west and north areas of the borough (areas of Norcot, Southcote and Lower Caversham).</p>\n<p>Figure 2: IMD 2015 by LSOA Map</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4998/image2/image/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office of National Statistics, IMD 2015</p>\n<p>The overall IMD score is composed of different elements; the areas identified above do not all experience deprivation in the same way. Figure 3 shows each ward&#8217;s rank in Reading (where 1 is the most deprived in each domain and 16 is the least deprived). The identified pattern is complex; Whitley ward is ranked highest for income deprivation, but appears to be less affected by crime, poor housing, air quality and road accidents. Similarly, despite a reasonably high ranking for income and education, Abbey ward is ranked low for health, crime, barriers to housing and services and living environment.</p>\n<p>Figure 3: IMD domain ranks for each Reading ward.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4999/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Department for Communities and Local Government. Part of Indices of Deprivation. 2015</p>\n<p>Similarly, the ten overall most deprived LSOAs rank relatively highly against other areas in Reading for living environment (housing condition and central heating, air pollution, road accidents), barriers to housing and services (road distances to schools, GP services, supermarkets, housing affordability, homelessness and overcrowding) and crime (rates of recorded crime) (See Table 1 below).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Rank of overall most deprived LSOAs in each IMD domain (1 is most deprived, 98 is least deprived)</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Dementia is a progressive and terminal disease caused when brain tissue is damaged.</p>\n<p>The condition is defined by a number of symptoms that include loss of memory, problems thinking, problem solving and language. This can result in changes in behaviour, which can disrupt people&#8217;s ability to live independently and may affect social and personal relationships.</p>\n<p>There are over 100 types of dementia, often named in relation to the condition that causes them. The most common (62% of cases) is Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease, which affects the structure and chemistry of the brain leading to death of brain cells.</p>\n<p>Vascular dementia (17% of cases) occurs when the oxygen supply to the brain is cut, for example by a stroke or progressively by a series of mini strokes resulting in the death of brain cells.</p>\n<p>Mixed Dementia (10% of cases) is where a person has been diagnosed with both Alzheimer&#8217;s and vascular dementia.</p>\n<p>Other rarer types of Dementia are described by the <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/info/20007/types_of_dementia/108/rarer_types_of_dementia\">Alzheimer&#8217;s Society</a>.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Older people are the largest single group receiving services from Adult Social Care in Reading, comprising 63% <em>(Referrals, Assessments and Packages of Care &#8211; RAP 2012/13) </em>of all service users.</p>\n<p>Nationally, we spend in total 52% <em>(</em><em>HSCIC 2014/15</em><em>) </em>on older people&#8217;s social care. 1 in 4 people over the age of 80 has Dementia. Some people progress through old age without ever having a social care need, and many others have a social care need for only a small fraction of time. However, around two in every three women and one in every two men can expect to have a high care need at some point during their retirement.</p>\n<h3>Local services for people living with dementia</h3>\n<p><strong>Reading Borough Council leads on a number of initiatives, including:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The provision of long term and short term residential care for people with dementia and the construction of a dementia friendly garden at The Willows Care Home in Reading.</li>\n<li>The provision of a day service for frail older people and people with dementia.</li>\n<li>Funding a befriending service &#8211; volunteers visit people with dementia and take part in activities with them.</li>\n<li>A number of support groups for both individuals with Dementia and carers.</li>\n<li>Dementia Support, <a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/berkshire/\">Age UK Berkshire</a> &#8211; This charged-for service is paid for by service users&#8217; families from Personal Budgets, own funds or in a small number of cases, directly by local authorities. Trained Age UK Berkshire employees work one-to-one with people living with dementia, enabling them to undertake social or individual activities of their choice. The service also provides some respite for carers and families.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The council&#8217;s Older People&#8217;s Commissioning Strategy is in development and has a focus on 4 core themes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure older people stay healthy and independent for longer.</li>\n<li>To ensure that all older people are safe and respected both in the community and when receiving support.</li>\n<li>To ensure that older people have choice and control over the services they receive and have access to the right information in order to make decisions.</li>\n<li>To ensure high quality services in health and social care through robust quality Monitoring</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Reading, there is already significant joint working between health agencies, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), local authorities and the voluntary sector; many examples of which are listed below).</p>\n<p>Locally there is a Berkshire West Dementia Stakeholders Group, with representation from health commissioners and providers, Unitary Authorities and the voluntary sector.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dementiaaction.org.uk/local_alliances/5845_reading_dementia_action_alliance\">Reading Dementia Action Alliance</a> (RDAA) hosted by the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society was formed at the beginning of August 2013. The aim of the DAA is to improve the lives of people with dementia and their Carers. The purpose of RDAA is to engage with local businesses, charities, voluntary and community services and independent providers as well as the statutory sector to create dementia friendly communities and to encourage organisations to sign up to the alliance. More information about the work of RDAA can be found on their <a href=\"http://www.dementiaaction.org.uk/local_alliances/5845_reading_dementia_action_alliance\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>In Reading many organisations have become Dementia Friends by attending a short awareness-raising session run by a Dementia Champion. The Dementia friendly project also involves inter-generational working with schools, colleges and youth groups in partnership with people affected by dementia and their Carers.</p>\n<p>In 2013/14, Berkshire West CCGs increased their investment into older people&#8217;s Mental Health Services in recognition of the costs associated with both the increase in the volume of patients with dementia and the prescribing issues relating to anti-dementia drugs. As a result, capacity in memory clinics has increased in light of growing demand &#8211; referrals increased across Berkshire by an average 15.8% over a 12 month period (approximately 30 new patients are referred into memory clinics each month).</p>\n<p>Four &#8216;Dementia Care Advisor&#8217; posts are funded by CCGs in West Berkshire. These provide information, advice, guidance and support to those newly diagnosed with dementia, their family and carers and has a dedicated post for people with early onset dementia.</p>\n<p>The Younger People with Dementia (YPWD) Group &#8211; is a charity, partly funded by Reading the CCGs. This service includes both workshops and 1 to 1 sessions for younger people with dementia.</p>\n<p>Other activities across West Berkshire include &#8216;Singing for the Brain&#8217;, &#8216;Walking for the Brain&#8217; and Dementia Cafes.</p>\n<p>Care Home In Reach Team (West of Berkshire) &#8211; The aims of this project are to deliver improved quality of life for people including those living with dementia, in selected residential and nursing homes; improve the skills of the care home staff through training, building their confidence and professionalism and improve communication for older people, including those living with dementia, and involvement of carers. This will include their involvement with anticipatory planning for End of Life care.</p>\n<p>Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST)</p>\n<p>Staff from The Maples Resource Centre for older people are trained in Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) group work and deliver CST sessions for service users living with dementia; which have been reported to have been positively received by both staff and those attending the sessions.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<h3>Incidence</h3>\n<p>Alzheimer&#8217;s UK reports that 685,812 people In England are reported to be living with dementia or which, the highest number (121,512) live in the South East.</p>\n<h3>Dementia by age and gender</h3>\n<p>National data shows the trends in dementia prevalence by gender and age. As shown in the graphs below prevalence is consistently higher in women than in men, most markedly in the 75 years and above age range; which may be representative of women&#8217;s higher life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Graph 1 &#8211; Number of adults diagnosed with dementia by gender and age group.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5099/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Graph 2 &#8211; Dementia prevalence by gender in under and over 75 year age groups.<span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5100/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<h3>Trends in dementia incidence and prevalence</h3>\n<p>Recently published <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanneurol/article/PIIS1474-4422(15)00092-7/abstract\">research</a> on dementia rates in Western Europe suggests that the predicted &#8216;dementia epidemic&#8217; in these countries, including the UK, may not be as fast growing as was previously thought. Most of the epidemiological evidence on which current policy making is based is now 20 years old. The predictions from this evidence are now out of date due to changes in living conditions, better healthcare, education and lifestyle improvements. Efforts to combat vascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol reduction may also be protecting against dementia. Four out of the five studies showed no significant changes in dementia incidence or prevalence between two time points. In the UK, there was a significant reduction (22%) in the predicted number of people aged 65+ with dementia compared to the predictions made in 1990.</p>\n<p>However, dementia is still a major health and social care challenge, partly due to significant growth in the number of people who are living for longer. As shown in the table below, prevalence increases in a linear fashion with age; with a notable increase in the percentage of the population living with the condition over the age of 79. The absolute numbers with dementia will likely mirror population ageing patterns.</p>\n<p>Table 1 &#8211; UK data on Dementia</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 607px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"UK data on dementia\" width=\"472\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Age range</th>\n<th>  % males</th>\n<th>% females</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>65-69</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>1.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>70-74</td>\n<td>3.1</td>\n<td>2.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>75-79</td>\n<td>5.1</td>\n<td>6.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80-85</td>\n<td>10.2</td>\n<td>13.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>85-89</td>\n<td>16.7</td>\n<td>22.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90+</td>\n<td>27.9</td>\n<td>30.7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>The table above illustrates the most recent, relevant source of UK data from <a href=\"https://www.dementiauk.org/\">Dementia UK</a>: A report into the prevalence and cost of dementia prepared by the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) at the London School of Economics and the Institute of Psychiatry at King&#8217;s College London, for the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society, 2007.</p>\n<p>The prevalence rates have been applied to  <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections\">Office for National Statistics population projections</a> of the 65 and over population to give estimated numbers of people predicted to have dementia to 2030.</p>\n<p>To calculate the prevalence rates for the 90+ population, rates from the research for the 90-94 and 95+ age groups have been applied to the England population 2006 to calculate the numbers in each age group, the sum of these groups is then expressed as a percentage of the total 90+ population to establish the predicted prevalence of the 90+ population as a whole.</p>\n<p>Graph 3 &#8211; People aged 65+ predicted to have dementia &#8211; projections to 2030 in Reading.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5101/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>(Source &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.poppi.org.uk/index.php?pageNo=316&amp;PHPSESSID=eftkjvhgnd92vp1pe5ktjquvm3&amp;sc=1&amp;loc=8325&amp;np=1\">POPPI</a> data 2014)</p>\n<p>Graph 4 &#8211; Predicted prevalence in dementia projected to 2030, Reading compared to neighbours in Berkshire:</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5102/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source &#8211; POPPI 2014</p>\n<p>Costs of Dementia to society</p>\n<p>Statistics from Alzheimer&#8217;s UK suggest that Dementia costs the UK £26.3 Billion a year, this includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unpaid care: £11.6bn</li>\n<li>Health care: £4.3bn</li>\n<li>State social care: £4.5bn</li>\n<li>Individual social care: £5.8bn</li>\n<li>Other costs: £0.1bn</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Residential costs:</h3>\n<p>In Reading, the Council&#8217;s 2015/16 usual costs for a residential placement is £700.00 / week for people with dementia. For nursing placements the usual cost (including Health contribution) is £811.11 for people with dementia.</p>\n<p>Population data from <a href=\"http://www.poppi.org.uk/index.php?pageNo=326&amp;PHPSESSID=eftkjvhgnd92vp1pe5ktjquvm3&amp;sc=1&amp;loc=8325&amp;np=1\">POPPI</a> shows that the increase in the older population in Reading will not be as high as it will be in the surrounding authorities. Using current Care Home placement figures and applying the percentage increase to the general population and for those with dementia the number of care home placements that will be needed in the borough is as follows.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Residential costs\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Residential 65+</th>\n<th>Residential Dementia</th>\n<th>Nursing 65+</th>\n<th>Nursing Dementia</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2020</td>\n<td>118</td>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>86</td>\n<td>46</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2025</td>\n<td>145</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>106</td>\n<td>54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2030</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>51</td>\n<td>146</td>\n<td>63</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source <a href=\"http://www.poppi.org.uk/index.php?pageNo=326&amp;PHPSESSID=eftkjvhgnd92vp1pe5ktjquvm3&amp;sc=1&amp;loc=8325&amp;np=1\">POPPI</a> (2014)</p>\n<p>Currently, there are 5 nursing homes in the borough that care for people with dementia providing149 beds registered for residential dementia care and in last financial year the Council was paying for 32 residential care home placements.</p>\n<p>Last financial year the Council was funding 115 nursing placements for older people in the Reading borough.

The figures above don&#8217;t take into account the need to reduce care home placements by 20 places a year or the effect extra care housing will have on the care home market once all of the schemes are completed. It is likely that the number of beds needed for residential care of over 65&#8217;s could be as much as 20% less than the figures shown in the table below:</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Residential beds\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Residential 65+</th>\n<th>Residential Dementia</th>\n<th>Nursing 65+</th>\n<th>Nursing Dementia</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2020</td>\n<td>118</td>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>86</td>\n<td>46</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2025</td>\n<td>145</td>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>106</td>\n<td>54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2030</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>51</td>\n<td>146</td>\n<td>63</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>To address this, the Council has procured a provider to build a new nursing home to cater for over 65 nursing and nursing dementia care in the borough.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There are 40,000 younger people with dementia in the UK. However, it is estimated that 44% of cases remain undiagnosed.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://dementiapartnerships.com/diagnosis/dementia-prevalence-calculator/\">Dementia Prevalence Calculator Tool</a> enables local areas to account for local factors and establish estimates of their local prevalence rates for all ages. According to the tool the adjusted figures for December 2015 are as follows: North &amp; West Reading CCG -71% of expected prevalence &amp; South Reading CCG &#8211; 70%. There is a national Directly Enhanced Service (DES) encouraging GPs to screen all at risk patients aiming to identify more people with possible dementia and refer them to the Memory Clinics.</li>\n<li>The Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) data for 2013-14 shows the following number of patients on the GP registers: North&amp; West Reading CCG &#8211; 564, South Reading CCG &#8211; 467.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Inequalities in service access:</h3>\n<p>Mental Health service provision does not reach all sections of the population evenly with those living in deprived areas, older people, and black and minority ethnic groups (BME) tending to face barriers to access. Stigma and discrimination may play a part in compounding these inequalities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are 25,000 people with dementia from black and minority ethnic groups in the UK. The ethnicity status of patients attending the memory clinics in Berkshire very closely mirrors the ethnicity profile of the &gt;65 years population in each unitary authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/\">Alzheimer&#8217;s Society</a> reports that many people with dementia have described an impaired quality of life</p>\n<ul>\n<li>61% felt anxious or depressed recently</li>\n<li>40% felt lonely recently.</li>\n<li>52% don&#8217;t feel they get enough support from the government.</li>\n<li>34% don&#8217;t feel part of their community.</li>\n<li>28% aren&#8217;t able to make decisions about how they spend their time.</li>\n<li>18% aren&#8217;t living well with dementia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>Dementia presents a huge challenge to society, both now and increasingly in the future. It is estimated that there are currently 7-800,000 people in the UK with dementia, of whom approximately 570,000 live in England. A lot can be done to help people cope with the symptoms of dementia. But at the moment, the diagnosis rate in England is only 67% &#8211; lower than Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg42/chapter/1-recommendations#promoting-and-maintaining-independence-of-people-with-dementia\">NICE</a> guidance on Dementia recommends that &#8216;Health and social care staff should aim to promote and maintain the independence, including mobility, of people with dementia. Care plans should address activities of daily living (ADLs) that maximise independent activity, enhance function, adapt and develop skills, and minimise the need for support&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s &#8216;Older People&#8217;s Commissioning Strategy&#8217; is in development and recognises that good care and support transforms lives, it enhances health and wellbeing, increasing independence, choice and control. It is distinctive, valued, and personal.</p>\n<p>All too often people experience services that are fragmented, poorly co-ordinated, and hard to navigate. Instead we need services that are personalised, of good quality, and much better co-ordinated and joined-up around the needs of the individual, with a parity of emphasis on our physical, mental, and other needs.</p>\n<p>The council&#8217;s new approach called &#8220;Right For You&#8221; or R4U begins with conversations rather than assessments, it builds on people&#8217;s strengths and existing connections and is based on a what a &#8216;Good Life&#8217; means to that person rather than &#8216;Need&#8217; and &#8216;services&#8217;.</p>\n<h3>Early onset dementia:</h3>\n<p>Services for dementia need to been tailored to the needs of the individual. Nationally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 in every 20 people living with dementia is under 65 years old.</li>\n<li>7 out of 10 people with dementia also have additional co-morbidities or disabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Younger people living with dementia may have different needs for care to older people as they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suffer from a rare or inherited form of dementia.</li>\n<li>More likely to still be in work and / or have a partner in work when diagnosed.</li>\n<li>Have dependent children and / or aging parents requiring care.</li>\n<li>Have greater financial commitments such as a mortgage.</li>\n<li>Be more physically fit and active.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Appropriate services should be accessible for both younger and older people with dementia.</p>\n<p>In Reading, a specific care pathway has been developed for patients with early onset dementia as well as a pathway for those diagnosed over the age of 65; both take into account options for the patient and carers.</p>\n<h3>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s Market Position Statement for Adult Social Care</h3>\n<p>Identifies what we are doing to increase provision for people with dementia and where there are currently gaps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The need for Extra Care Housing that is suitable for people with dementia has already been identified, and the Council plans to work with providers to ensure Extra Care Housing is available that is suitable for people with dementia.</li>\n<li>The Council&#8217;s Quality Team is focusing on supporting quality among residential homes that specialise in dementia, to ensure there is enough provision for this group.</li>\n<li>In Reading, there is reliance on a small number of providers for nursing care provision. 78% of nursing care beds for people with dementia in Reading are held in one home. Market failure in this area is therefore a significant risk and the council is looking to develop alternative options, by developing new provision in the borough.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/common-causes-of-death-and-disability/\">Common causes of death &amp; disability</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/residential-and-nursing-care-provision/\">Residential &amp; Nursing care provision</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>1 &#8211; Fernandez J-L and Forder J (2009) Analysing the costs and benefits of social care funding arrangements in England: technical report.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Reading has a higher rate than average of premature death, with a particularly high rate of deaths from heart attack and stroke and cancer. The number of people with a disability or other limiting condition is similar to national average, but still represents a significant proportion of the population. There is strong evidence that those living in more deprived areas are more likely to die prematurely and more likely to be affected by disability. Prevention interventions, especially those focusing on increasing physical activity and improving diet and weight management, reducing smoking and alcohol use are likely to be effective in addressing many of the common causes of disability and premature death.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<h2>The most common causes of death</h2>\n<p><em>The most common cause of death in England and Wales in 2014 was cancer (29%), followed by circulatory diseases, such as heart attack and stroke (27%). Age-standardised mortality rates (the proportionate number of people dying in each age group) continued to decline</em> in 2014, continuing an ongoing trend (see Figure 1) (Office for National Statistics (ONS), 2015)</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Age-standardised mortality rates 2001-2014</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5020/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Deaths Registered in England and Wales: 2014. Office for National Statistics.</p>\n<p>Public Health England (PHE, 2015) publishes data about premature mortality (deaths of people under the age of 75. Life expectancy is linked to levels of deprivation and how long we live depends greatly on where we live. Understanding trends and patterns in premature mortality can be used to highlight health inequalities and how they affect local authority areas.</p>\n<p>Overall, Reading has an above-average premature death rate. As shown in Figure 1, Reading ranks 95th out of the 150 local authorities in England with 379 deaths for every 100,000 people aged under 75 each year. The highest rate is in Manchester (535 deaths per 100,000 people) and the lowest is in Kensington and Chelsea (244 deaths per 100,000 people). Reading is ranked 13th out of 15 local authorities with similar levels of deprivation (lowest in this group is Redbridge (288 deaths for every 100,000) and highest is Bury (397 deaths for every 100,000).</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Rates of premature deaths per 100,000 population by Local Authority</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5021/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health England &#8211; Mortality Rankings <a href=\"http://healthierlives.phe.org.uk/topic/mortality\">http://healthierlives.phe.org.uk/topic/mortality</a></p>\n<p>Closer examination of the main causes of premature death show that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the commonest cause of premature death in Reading is cancer. Between 2012 and 2014, there were142 deaths per 100,000 people aged under 75 in Reading. Reading is ranked 72nd highest of 150 local authorities. The highest rate was in Manchester (196 deaths for every 100,000 people) and the lowest in Harrow (106 deaths for every 100,000 people).</li>\n<li>the next most common cause of premature death is heart attack and stroke (92 deaths per 100,000). Reading is ranked very high &#8211; 115th out of 150 local authorities in the country. The highest rate was in Manchester (135 deaths per 100,000) and the lowest in Kensington and Chelsea (48 deaths per 100,000);</li>\n<li>the third most common cause of death in Reading is respiratory disease (37 deaths per 100,000), Reading ranks 89th highest out of 150 local authorities. The highest rate was in Manchester (72 deaths per 100,000) and the lowest in Bath and North East Somerset (18 deaths per 100,000).</li>\n<li><em>the</em> fourth most common cause of death is liver disease (23 deaths per 100,000). Reading ranks 109th highest out of 150 local authorities. The highest rate was in Blackpool (40 deaths per 100,000) and the lowest in Buckinghamshire (10 deaths per 100,000).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As elsewhere, premature death is more common in areas where deprivation is higher. Figure 2 shows a high correlation (0.86, close to &#8216;perfect&#8217; correlation of &#8216;1&#8217;) between ward IMD score and premature death. The difference in life expectancy between the most and least deprived in Reading is 9.1 years (PHE, 2016).</p>\n<p>Figure 2: The relationship between premature mortality and deprivation in Reading</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5022/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Primary Care Mortality Database and IMD rankings (ONS)</p>\n<p>Mapping rates of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease, for which Reading is ranked particularly high, demonstrates that there tend to be higher rates in those wards where deprivation is also higher (see Figure 3, below) (high deprivation is particularly notable in: the far south of Whitley ward and the Northumberland Avenue area in the south of the borough; throughout Abbey ward and around the town centre; around Dee Road in Norcot ward; around Coronation Square in Southcote ward; and around Amersham Road in Lower Caversham &#8211; see Deprivation by Ward and LSOA section).</p>\n<p>Figure 3: Low, medium and high death rates from cardiovascular disease under the age of 75 years in Reading</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5023/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></em></p>\n<h2>The most common causes of disability</h2>\n<p>The 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study (Vos et al, 2015) reports on the incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability of 301 acute and chronic diseases in 188 countries (including the UK) over a period of 23 years. The study shows that between 1990 and 2013 an increasing number have been living with more than one long-term condition or disability as they get older. Put another way, people are living longer and many are experiencing increasing disability and poorer health as they do so. This has obvious implications for health and social care services.</p>\n<p>In common with most other high income countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, the USA, western Europe and the Scandinavian countries, the top ten causes of disability and years lived with disability in the UK are, in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>back pain;</li>\n<li>neck pain;</li>\n<li>falls;</li>\n<li>major depressive disorder;</li>\n<li>diabetes;</li>\n<li>hearing problems;</li>\n<li>migraine;</li>\n<li>anxiety;</li>\n<li>other musculoskeletal disorders; and</li>\n<li>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the most recent Census, Reading is reported to have an age-standardised rate of 17% of residents who reported that their activities were limited by a disability in some way. This is similar to the rate of 16% for the South East and slightly lower than the rate of 19% for all of England (ONS, 2013). Applied crudely to the total population at the time of the Census, this would equate to around 26,500 people who are reporting that their daily life is effected by a disability .</p>\n<p>Disability-free life expectancy, like life expectancy itself, tends to be lower as deprivation increases (ONS, 2012), meaning that those living in the more deprived areas of Reading are more likely to be living with a disability or limiting condition.</p>\n<p>Whilst the various conditions and disabilities in this list are rarely direct causes of death, they cause substantial problems for the people suffering from them and will have an impact on demand for health and social care services. Many of the most common conditions (notably back pain, the rate of falls, and depression) can be avoided or ameliorated by increased physical exercise (DoH, 2004; Royal College of Physicians, 2012; Gillespie et al, 2012; Age UK, 2013a; WHO, 2004; Age UK, 2013b; Rimer et al, 2012).</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Reading has a higher rate than average of premature death, with a particularly high rate of deaths from heart attack and stroke. The number of people with disability or other limiting condition is similar to national average, but still a significant proportion of the population.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>There is strong evidence that those living in more deprived areas are more likely to die prematurely and more likely to be affected by disability. In addition, a local analysis of premature mortality rates and IMD score by ward shows high correlation. Mapping of rates of deaths from cardiovascular disease for those aged under 75 shows that the most deprived areas of Reading tend to have higher rates.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>Prevention interventions, especially those focusing on increasing physical activity and improving diet and weight management, reducing smoking and alcohol use are likely to be effective with many of the common causes of disability and premature death.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/deprivation-by-ward-and-lower-super-output-area/\">Deprivation by Ward and Lower Super Output Area</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cardiovascular-disease/\">Cardiovascular Disease</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cancer/\">Cancer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/diabetes/\">Diabetes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/drugs-and-alcohol/\">Drugs &amp; Alcohol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental health</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Age UK (2013a). <em>Falls Prevention Exercise &#8211; following the evidence.</em> Age UK.

    "title": "Communicable diseases",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Communicable diseases are those that are transmittable from one person, or animal, to another. The disease may spread directly, via another species (vector) or via the environment. The spread of disease in the community is determined by environmental and social conditions that favour the infectious agent, and the relative immunity of the population.</p>\n<p>Healthcare associated infections (HCAI) are those infections which are acquired as a result of healthcare, often among people being cared for in hospital. HCAI are a public health problem because infections can spread quickly among hospitalised patients who are already experiencing other health problems and may have worse outcomes than similar infections in previously healthy people. Mandatory surveillance for certain types of HCAI is undertaken by Public Health England (PHE).</p>\n<p>Public Health England provides local health protection services and leads the public health response to all communicable disease outbreaks and emergencies that need specialist expertise. They give local government, especially the Director of Public Health, access to specialised advice and support, which help to support the improvement of the health and wellbeing of their local population. The prevention and control of healthcare associated infections is led by infection prevention and control teams within NHS organisations, supported where appropriate by PHE.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<h3>Tuberculosis (TB)</h3>\n<p>Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. Nationally, the rate of Tuberculosis (TB) infections has continued to increase in recent years. The incidence of TB in England is higher than most other Western European countries, and more than four times as high as in the USA. The majority of TB in England occurs in a small number of high incidence areas, two of which are in Berkshire. TB disproportionately affects more deprived populations and the majority of cases occur in people who were born outside the UK, often as a result of activation of previously asymptomatic (dormant/inactive) infection in new entrants. In Berkshire, TB services are of high quality with good treatment completion rates; however, referral of new entrants for screening needs to be improved. The Collaborative Tuberculosis Strategy for England was launched in 2015 and aims to achieve a year on year reduction in TB incidence and associated health inequalities and eventually to eliminate TB as a public health problem.</p>\n<h3>Gastrointestinal Infections</h3>\n<p>Gastrointestinal infections are those affecting the digestive system and often cause vomiting and or diarrhoea. Symptoms can vary in duration and severity depending on the pathogen (bug causing the infection).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campylobacter continues to be the most common cause of reported gastroenteritis nationally and locally, followed by Salmonella. (Figure 2) Many people do not seek care for mild gastrointestinal symptoms and so numbers of confirmed cases are likely to underestimate the true level of infections.</li>\n<li>Historically hepatitis E was considered a travel-associated infection, and the disease may have been under diagnosed locally and nationally. Numbers of hepatitis E cases have increased since 2010 in Berkshire, in line with the national picture.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Blood-borne Viruses (BBVs)</h3>\n<p>Blood-borne viruses (BBVs) are viruses that some people carry in their blood and can be spread from one person to another.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> &#8211; Berkshire has the highest rate of hepatitis B notifications out of the three counties in Thames Valley. Nationally, around 4% of cases notified are at the acute stage of infection when the case is most infectious. 56% of acute cases had associated exposure information, with the most common reported risk attributed being heterosexual exposure. 62 out of 457 national acute or probable acute cases of hepatitis B were reported in the south east in 2015. This gives a rate of 0.69 per 100,000, a decrease from 0.71 in 2014. This is in line with the national picture, which decreased from 0.91 to 0.87. (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-b-annual-report-for-2013\">Acute hepatitis B (England): annual report for 2015</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</strong> &#8211; Hepatitis C is a major public health problem with estimates of large numbers of undiagnosed infections. The majority of these are in current or former injecting drug users, where up to 50% are estimated to be infected with Hepatitis C. New direct acting antiviral drugs offer a fast and effective cure to the majority who receive them; with reduced complications compared to previous treatments. 40% more people are initiating HCV treatment in 2015, when compared to 2014. Deaths from HCV have reduced in 2015, ending the upward trend of the last 10 years. (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-c-in-the-uk\">Hepatitis C in the UK: 2016 report</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Group A Streptococcal Disease</h3>\n<p>Nationally, notifications of Group A Streptococcal disease increased during the 2015-2016 season and continue to be monitored by Public Health England. The number of invasive infections caused by the same bacterium also showed increased incidence in 2015-2016, no novel strains or unusual increases in specific strains have been identified. Levels of scarlet fever and invasive Group A Streptococcal infections in Thames Valley and across Berkshire reflected the national picture.

In Berkshire, rates of C. difficile have decreased in the last five years across all Hospital Trusts.</p>\n<h3>Antimicrobial resistance: is covered in the <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/antimicrobial-resistance/\">antimicrobial resistance section</a>.</h3>\n<p><strong>Vaccine Preventable Diseases: </strong>are covered in the Immunisation section.</p>\n<p><strong>Sexually Transmitted Diseases including HIV:</strong> are covered in the <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/sexual-health/\">Sexual Health section</a>.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures and Trends</h2>\n<h3>Mortality</h3>\n<p>Mortality from infectious and parasitic diseases shows the total number of deaths in a population from those diseases during a given time period. As the number of deaths in an area will be heavily influenced by the age and gender of the population, these factors are controlled by standardisation and presented as a rate per 100,000. This allows a more direct comparison between areas that have different population structures. Figure 1 shows that in Reading, the mortality from infectious and parasitic diseases was comparable with regional and national averages between 1995 and 2010. This rose above the England and South East rates in 2011 and then decreased between 2012 and 2014 but remaining above the England and South East rates. There were 78 deaths from communicable disease in Reading in 2014.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Mortality from infectious and parasitic disease in Reading, 1995 to 2014</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4865/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p><em>Source: Health and Social Care Information Centre &#8211; NHS Indicator Portal</em></p>\n<h2>Incidence of communicable disease</h2>\n<p>Figure 2 shows the number of communicable diseases in Reading by type of infection and pathogen (bug causing the infection) between 2012 and 2016.

The Local Authority, partners in health and the voluntary sector work collaboratively wherever possible to improve the current and future opportunities for our children and young people.</p>\n<p>However, there are many issues that can be seen as barriers that restrict these opportunities. There are significant numbers of children living in poverty, children who are looked after generally are at greater risk of poorer health and need extensive support, there are high numbers of children in need, children with disabilities can be significantly disadvantaged and young carers can miss out from the opportunities that other young people, who don&#8217;t have a caring role, have.</p>\n<p>The All Party Parliamentary Group report &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.fph.org.uk/inquiry%3A_child_poverty_and_health_%E2%80%93_the_impact_of_the_welfare_reform_and_work_bill_2015-2016\">Inquiry: Child Poverty and Health (APPG, 2016)</a> re-affirms that children who are living in poverty are at an increased risk of experiencing poor health outcomes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/\">Reading&#8217;s Local Safeguarding Children Board</a> makes sure that key agencies work together to keep local children and young people safe. The Board&#8217;s role is to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, and ensure the effectiveness of what is done by each agency that works with children. More information can be found in the &#8216;Safeguarding Children&#8217; JSNA section regarding local safeguarding issues.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<h3>Child poverty</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/9/contents\">Child Poverty Act 2010</a> defines child poverty as follows: &#8220;A child is taken to be living in poverty if the child experiences socio-economic disadvantage.&#8221; By &#8216;socio-economic disadvantage&#8217; the government means &#8216;lacking parental resources and/or opportunities to participate in meaningful activities, services and relationships&#8217;. In reality this means missing out on school trips, socialising with friends, days out and family holidays.</p>\n<p>Translating this into terms that can be measured, child poverty can be summarised as a child living in a household that has less than 60% of the national median income (<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05585/SN05585.pdf\">Child Poverty Act 2010: a short guide, 2014</a>). However, the Government wants to strengthen the child poverty measure to make it relevant in today&#8217;s society (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-child-poverty-measure\">DWP, 2015</a>).</p>\n<p>Reading is the largest urban area within Berkshire, with a population of around 160,000. There has been significant expansion over the last 20 years, changing Reading from a market town to a vibrant city in the making. Despite its prosperity, however, Reading contains some of the most deprived wards in the country. There is a strong relationship between poverty, deprivation and poor health and education outcomes which can reduce opportunities for the local population.</p>\n<h3>Children in Need</h3>\n<p>A child in need is defined under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/contents\">Children Act 1989</a> as &#8216;a child who is unlikely to achieve or maintain a reasonable level of health or development, or whose health and development is likely to be significantly or further impaired, without the provision of services; or a child who is disabled&#8217;.</p>\n<h3>Disability</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-disability-issues\">Office for Disability Issues (2014)</a> estimates that there are 0.8 million disabled children in Great Britain. This estimate covers the number of children with a longstanding illness, disability or infirmity, and who have a significant difficulty with day-to-day activities. 21% of children in families with at least one disabled family member are in poverty, a significantly higher proportion than the 16% of children in families with no disabled family member.</p>\n<h3>Young carers</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/detailed-characteristics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/sty-young-unpaid-care.html\">2011 Census</a> identified that nationally, there were 177,918 young carers (children under the age of 18 years) providing regular and ongoing care to a family member who is physically or mentally ill, disabled or misuses substances. In reality, this figure is likely to be much higher.</p>\n<p>Young carers may be reluctant to identify themselves to services due to concerns about being taken into care or bullying. Most young carers are aged between 10 and 17 years of age with most providing between 1-19 hours of care a week <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/\">(Office of National Statistics, 2011)</a>. However, 8.8% of young carers in 2011 were providing high levels of care (defined as 50 or more hours a week). Similar to adults, young carers are more likely to describe their health as &#8220;not good&#8221; when compared to young people not providing care. This was particularly likely for young carers providing more than 50 hours a week, who were 5 times a likely to have &#8220;not good&#8221; health compared to those not providing care (<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/detailed-characteristics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/sty-young-unpaid-care.html\">Office for National Statistics, 2011</a>).</p>\n<p>Providing a caring role can impact negatively on a young carer&#8217;s emotional development and their ability to build relationships with others, with young carers being at a higher risk of experiencing depression and self-harm. Young carers may come to light through issues at school, such as poor attendance, lateness and bullying. However, these along with anxiety, fatigue and limited access to extracurricular activities can all manifest themselves in lower educational attainment.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<h3>Child poverty</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/464431/English_Index_of_Multiple_Deprivation_2015_-_Infographic.pdf\">English Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015</a> provided an updated ranking of all Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in the country, from 1st most deprived to 32,884th least deprived areas. LSOAs are small areas of an average of 1,500 residents each, who share similar economic and social conditions.</p>\n<p>A supplementary index was produced alongside this, relating to Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI). This indicates that Reading is in the 6th least deprived decile of local authorities in England (using average score of the Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in the Borough). 6 (6%) of the LSOAs in Reading are in the 10% most deprived in England according to the IDACI measures. Neighbourhoods in Norcot, Church, Whitley and Redlands wards were the most deprived.</p>\n<p><em>Children in poverty (under 16s):</em> this is defined as the percentage of children in low income families (children living in families in receipt of out of work benefits or tax credits where their reported income is less than 60% median income). In 2012, 19.4% of children under 16 were in poverty in Reading (Public health outcomes framework). This is similar to the England figure. Figure 1 below shows the trend over recent years. Reading has been consistently above the England and other areas in the fifth least deprived deciles.</p>\n<p><em>Children in poverty (all dependent children under 20):</em> this is defined as the percentage of dependent children aged under 20 in relative poverty (living in households where income is less than 60 per cent of median household income before housing costs). In 2012, 18.8% of dependent children under 20 were in poverty in Reading. This is higher than the England figure of 18.6% (Public health outcomes framework).</p>\n<p>Reading is described in the <a href=\"http://www.chimat.org.uk/profiles\">Child Health Profiles</a> as having a level of child poverty that is worse than the England average, with 22.2% of children aged under 16 years living in poverty. This means that almost 1 in 4 of the children being brought up in the Borough are living in poverty.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Children in poverty (under 16) trends (2006-2012) <span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5196/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Public health outcomes framework</p>\n<p>Table 1 below shows that, in 2014, there were 5,560 children aged 18 and under in Reading living in 2,900 households that were claiming out of work benefits.</p>\n<p>Table 1: Number of Children living in all Out-of-work Benefit Claimant Households by Local Authority and Age at May 2014</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Number of Children living in all Out-of-work Benefit Claimant Households by Local Authority and Age at May 2014\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Local Authority</th>\n<th>Age 0-4</th>\n<th>Age 5-10</th>\n<th>Age 11-15</th>\n<th>Age 16-18</th>\n<th></th>\n<th>Age 0-15</th>\n<th>Age 0-18</th>\n<th></th>\n<th>Number of Households</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Bracknell Forest UA</th>\n<td>810</td>\n<td>850</td>\n<td>480</td>\n<td>210</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2,140</td>\n<td>2,340</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1,250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Brighton and Hove UA</th>\n<td>2,350</td>\n<td>2,340</td>\n<td>1,710</td>\n<td>890</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6,390</td>\n<td>7,290</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Isle of Wight UA</th>\n<td>1,410</td>\n<td>1,330</td>\n<td>980</td>\n<td>540</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3,730</td>\n<td>4,260</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2,380</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Medway UA</th>\n<td>3,980</td>\n<td>3,570</td>\n<td>2,510</td>\n<td>1,100</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>10,060</td>\n<td>11,160</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5,970</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Milton Keynes UA</th>\n<td>3,530</td>\n<td>3,080</td>\n<td>2,070</td>\n<td>860</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>8,670</td>\n<td>9,540</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4,860</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Portsmouth UA</th>\n<td>3,040</td>\n<td>2,710</td>\n<td>1,600</td>\n<td>710</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>7,360</td>\n<td>8,070</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4,340</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading UA</th>\n<td>2,050</td>\n<td>1,800</td>\n<td>1,200</td>\n<td>510</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5,050</td>\n<td>5,560</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Slough UA</th>\n<td>1,890</td>\n<td>1,870</td>\n<td>1,290</td>\n<td>660</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5,060</td>\n<td>5,720</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Southampton UA</th>\n<td>3,570</td>\n<td>3,070</td>\n<td>1,980</td>\n<td>950</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>8,630</td>\n<td>9,580</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5,010</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>West Berkshire UA</th>\n<td>1,050</td>\n<td>910</td>\n<td>620</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2,580</td>\n<td>2,880</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Windsor and Maidenhead UA</th>\n<td>680</td>\n<td>650</td>\n<td>420</td>\n<td>210</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1,750</td>\n<td>1,960</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1,060</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Wokingham UA</th>\n<td>670</td>\n<td>590</td>\n<td>410</td>\n<td>190</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1,660</td>\n<td>1,850</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1,030</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/children-in-out-of-work-benefit-households-31-may-2014\">DWP &#8211; Official statistics (July 2015)</a></p>\n<p>Reading Borough&#8217;s level of child poverty is above the national average and this has damaging consequences. 30% of Reading Pupils are eligible for pupil premium. This is the highest level in Berkshire where the average is 20%. The Child Poverty Action Group estimates the cost of child poverty in Reading to be £85million per year in cost of services (for example NHS and schools), lost tax receipts, cost of benefits and loss of earnings (<a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/media/2295/Tackling-Poverty-Needs-Analysis/pdf/Tackling_Poverty_Needs_Analysis.pdf\">Tackling Poverty in Reading: Needs Analysis, 2014</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/9/contents\">Child Poverty Act 2010</a> defines a child as living in poverty if they live in a household with an income below 60% of the UK median household income before housing costs are deducted and set targets for reducing the overall number in the UK. There is a number of proxy indicators used to estimate the number of children in poverty in local areas.</p>\n<h3>Children in Low-Income Families</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/personal-tax-credits-children-in-low-income-families-local-measure-2013-snapshot-as-at-31-august-2013\">Children in Low-Income Families Local Measure</a> provides the number and proportion of children living in families either in receipt of out-of-work or in receipt of tax credits where the reported household income is less than 60 per cent of national median income. The snapshot data for 2013 (published November 2015) indicates that 6,230 children in families in receipt of in-work and out-of-work benefits in Reading had a household income of less than 60% of the median, equivalent to 17.8% of children in the borough. This is similar to the percentages for all of England and UK (18.0% and 18.1% respectively), but higher than the percentage for the South-East (13.2%), suggesting that there are patterns of deprivation in Reading that distinguish it from its neighbouring boroughs (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/personal-tax-credits-children-in-low-income-families-local-measure-2013-snapshot-as-at-31-august-2013\">HMRC, 2015</a>). An analysis of these figures by ward, shown in Figure 2 below, demonstrates a wide discrepancy between the most and least deprived wards in Reading. The lowest levels occur in Mapledurham (2.7% in 2013), Peppard (6.7%) and Thames (3.8%), and the highest in Whitley (27.2%), Church (25.2%) and Norcot (23.5%).</p>\n<p>Further analysis undertaken in Reading&#8217;s &#8216;Tackling Poverty in Reading&#8217; Needs Analysis also examines numbers of children in poverty at Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) and identifies the very highest numbers in the North of Whitley ward and the Amersham Road area of Caversham. There are also high numbers in the South of Whitley, the Northumberland Avenue area between Whitley and Church wards, the Oxford Road area of Battle and Kentwood wards, and the Coley area of Minster ward. The map below in Figure 3 gives a colour coded view of the numbers of children living in poverty across Reading.</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Children in low income families by ward, 2011-13</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5206/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: HMRC, 2015</p>\n<p>Figure 3: Numbers of children living in poverty by LSOA.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5207/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: RBC, 2015</p>\n<h3>Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index</h3>\n<p>When the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index is used to compare the wards in Reading (Figure 4 below) a slightly different picture to the Children in Low-Income Families measure (Figure 5 below) is produced. This is likely to reflect the inclusion in the IDACI of those who are on low incomes but not eligible for in-work benefits. Local information suggests that Reading may have a higher rate of people in low-paid work than other areas (RBC, 2015).</p>\n<p>Figure 4: IDACI score by ward, 2015</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5208/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2015</p>\n<p>Using IDACI to analyse LSOAs also produces a slightly different pattern to that seen when using the Children in Low-Incomes Families measure, but both measures indicate areas of high numbers of children in poverty around North Whitley, Amersham Road, South Whitley, Northumberland Avenue and Oxford Road.</p>\n<p>Figure 5: Income deprivation affecting child poverty by LSOA, 2015</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5209/image5/image/image5.png\" alt=\"image5 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2015</p>\n<h3>Pupil Premium</h3>\n<p>The Pupil Premium is the additional targeted funding for publicly funded schools in England to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils, closing the gap between them and their peers. Allocation of the Pupil Premium is also used as a proxy to indicate the number of children living in poverty in local authority areas and in schools. 28.4% of Reading pupils are eligible for the Pupil Premium, compared to 22.6% in the South-East and 29.5% for England.</p>\n<p>Comparing the proportion of pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium in non-selective, mainstream primary and secondary schools suggests trends in some ways broadly similar to those seen above, with high proportions of eligibility in some Whitley schools, and very low proportions of eligibility in Peppard and Thames wards. It is notable, however, that some wards have both a school with a very high proportion of eligible pupils and a school with a very low proportion of eligible pupils, suggesting a range of levels of income and deprivation amongst those living within these wards.</p>\n<p>Table 2: Percentage of pupils eligible for Pupil Premium, 2015-16</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Percentage of pupils eligible for Pupil Premium, 2015-16\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"4\">10 Reading schools with highest % eligible for Pupil Premium 2015-16</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Name</td>\n<td>% eligible for Pupil Premium</td>\n<td>Ward</td>\n<td>Total no. pupils</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>John Madejski Academy (Secondary)</td>\n<td>53.92</td>\n<td>Whitley</td>\n<td>746</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Geoffrey Field Junior School</td>\n<td>48.59</td>\n<td>Whitley</td>\n<td>319</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whitley Park Primary</td>\n<td>48.36</td>\n<td>Whitley</td>\n<td>550</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Palmer Primary Academy</td>\n<td>45.69</td>\n<td>Katesgrove</td>\n<td>370</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranikhet Primary Academy</td>\n<td>45.49</td>\n<td>Norcot</td>\n<td>244</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manor Primary School</td>\n<td>44.85</td>\n<td>Southcote</td>\n<td>301</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Ridgeway Primary School</td>\n<td>44.19</td>\n<td>Church</td>\n<td>258</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meadow Park Academy</td>\n<td>41.95</td>\n<td>Kentwood</td>\n<td>298</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading Girls School (Secondary)</td>\n<td>39.8</td>\n<td>Church</td>\n<td>593</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moorlands Primary School</td>\n<td>39.3</td>\n<td>Tilehurst</td>\n<td>430</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Reading schools with lowest % eligible for Pupil Premium 2015-16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Caversham Primary School</td>\n<td>4.27</td>\n<td>Thames</td>\n<td>445</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>St Martins Catholic Primary School</td>\n<td>4.76</td>\n<td>Peppard</td>\n<td>168</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emmer Green Primary School</td>\n<td>6.46</td>\n<td>Peppard</td>\n<td>480</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Hill Primary School</td>\n<td>8.92</td>\n<td>Peppard</td>\n<td>471</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Caversham Park Primary School</td>\n<td>11.33</td>\n<td>Peppard</td>\n<td>203</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Redlands Primary School</td>\n<td>12.08</td>\n<td>Redlands</td>\n<td>240</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All Saints COE Infant School</td>\n<td>13.11</td>\n<td>Minster</td>\n<td>61</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>St Johns COE Primary School</td>\n<td>13.69</td>\n<td>Abbey</td>\n<td>358</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alfred Sutton Primary School</td>\n<td>14.83</td>\n<td>Park</td>\n<td>499</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All Saints COE Junior School</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Minster</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Highdown School (secondary)</td>\n<td>15.49</td>\n<td>Thames</td>\n<td>1,072</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>E.

The largest age group is 10 to 15 year olds, which made up 38% of looked after children at 31 March 2014. There has been a slight increase in the percentage of 16 and over, from 18% in 2010, to 21% in 2014. These trends are in line with the age breakdown of all children.</p>\n<p>Table 3 below shows the number of new LAC entrants per month from April 2014 &#8211; March 2015.

Under 1&#8217;s are higher as this age range is removed from the home whilst the social worker is carrying out the assessment as they are usually too vulnerable. It is positive to see that early identification and analysis of risk has led to protective measures being taken for the most vulnerable group; that of babies. Greater awareness of &#8216;The Southwark Judgement&#8217; is likely to underpin the comparatively large number of 16+ young people entering care.</p>\n<p>Emotional well-being of LAC is a good proxy measure of how young people are coping while being looked after and understanding future risk of experiencing mental health problems. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is used to assess emotional well-being of LAC aged 5 &#8211; 16. Scores are submitted to a national database which allows comparisons to other regions. The higher the score the higher the risk. Figure 7 below shows that Reading scores are consistently higher than the England average; however, the gap is narrowing. Continued emotional support for LAC in Reading should help to maintain the downward trend and continue to narrow the gap.</p>\n<p>Figure 7.

Reading serves a very diverse community, so demographically these figures could be under-representative locally. This data is not reflective of whether we are meeting the BME group needs when it comes to safeguarding children. BME communities don&#8217;t always present to children&#8217;s services so we must question this data and ask ourselves whether we are able to challenge behaviours when there is a cultural difference.</p>\n<p>Figure 9: LAC Ethnicity data</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image8\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5212/image8/image/image8.png\" alt=\"image8 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Purple Book, 2014</p>\n<p>Table 4 compares Readings LAC ethnicity data to that of England&#8217;s average.

This could be associated with staff&#8217;s high caseloads and absence.</p>\n<p>Figure 10 &#8211; Factors identified at the end of assessment for episodes in the year ending 31 March 2015</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 10 – Factors identified at the end of assessment for episodes in the year ending 31 March 2015\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5217/Figure-10--Factors-identified-at-the-end-of-assessment-for-episodes-in-the-year-ending-31-March-2015/image/Figure_10___Factors_identified_at_the_end_of_assessment_for_episodes_in_the_year_ending_31_March_201.png\" alt=\"Figure 10 – Factors identified at the end of assessment for episodes in the year ending 31 March 2015 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 10 – Factors identified at the end of assessment for episodes in the year ending 31 March 2015</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/characteristics-of-children-in-need-2014-to-2015\">Children in Need Census</a></p>\n<p>Figure 10 above shows the factors identified at the end of an assessment.

This is a rate of 432.5 per 10,000 children, significantly higher than the national rate and the rate for Berkshire. Figure 13 below shows that Reading&#8217;s rate has consistently been higher over recent years. 157 of Reading&#8217;s CIN had a disability, which was 10.5% of all CIN. At the same time, 154 children were the subject of a child protection plan in Reading. This is a rate of 44.4 per 10,000 children, compared with a national rate of 42.1.</p>\n<p>Figure 13.

The latest data release included information for 2014/15 Q3 (Oct-Dec 2014) at an England level. At this time, the percentage of NEET young people fell across all summary age groups in England and was the lowest on record for 16-18 year olds. The 16-18 NEET rate fell to 7.0%, the 19-24 rate fell to 15.9% and the overall 16-24 rate fell to 13.1%. For both 16-18 and 19-24 year olds, this change was driven by a fall in the proportion of those not in education or training (NEET) and a rise in the employment rate of the NEET group <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-neet\">(ONS, 2016)</a>.</p>\n<p>An indicator to measure the proportion of 16-18 year olds who are NEET is included in the <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a>. This indicator is published annually and uses the average proportion of NEETs between November and January each year. In 2013/14, 6.3% (270) of 16-18 year olds in Reading were NEET. This is a significant improvement on 2012/13&#8217;s figure, but is still significantly worse than the national figure of 5.3% (<a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">PHE, 2014</a>).</p>\n<p>Figure 19 and Table 5 show the percentage of 16-18 year olds known to the Local Authority who were NEET for the end of 2013/14. The NEET data used is an average from the end of November 2013, December 2013 and January 2014. This data relates to where young people live, rather that the area that they attended school or college. For Reading, the average rate was 6.7% of 16 to 18 year olds who were NEET, a decrease from 8.4% in 2012/13. This is still higher than the national average but lower than the average of Local Authorities with similar levels of deprivation. The decrease is to be welcomed, however, caution must be taken when benchmarking data. There are significant fluctuations in the numbers of young people where NEET/EET activity is recorded as &#8216;Not Known&#8217; by authorities. The &#8216;Not Known&#8217; percentage for Reading in 2012 was 2.8%. The average &#8216;Not Known&#8217; percentage for South East was 13% in 2012. The higher the percentage of &#8216;Not Known&#8217; is, the less reliable the NEET data becomes. Data for the comparator deprivation decile is currently only available for 2013.</p>\n<p>Figure 19: 16 to 18 year olds not in employment education or training 2011 to 2015</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 19\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5219/Figure-19/image/Figure_19_16_to_18_year_olds_not_in_employment_education_or_training_2011_to_2015.png\" alt=\"Figure 19 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 19</span></span></p>\n<p>Table 5: 16 to 18 year olds not in employment education or training 2011 to 2013</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"16 to 18 year olds not in employment education or training 2011 to 2013\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Reading</th>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Deprivation decile</th>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">England</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">2011</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">8.70%</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">N/A</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">6.10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">2012</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">8.40%</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">N/A</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">5.80%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">2013</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">6.30%</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">7.01%</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">5.30%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Public Health England, <a href=\"http://www.phoutcomes.info/\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a>.

These reflect the approach in the national Child Poverty Strategy and provide a useful framework:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving Life Chances &#8211; breaking the cycle.</li>\n<li>Supporting those who can&#8217;t work / on low incomes &#8211; income maximisation.</li>\n<li>Increasing Employability / Addressing Low Income &#8211; up-skilling and employment support.</li>\n<li>Creating Sustainable Communities &#8211; improving quality of life in our more deprived communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>NEET</h3>\n<p>Recent National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) (Nelson and O&#8217;Donnell, 2012) identifies 3 key elements to effective national policy  strategy including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Macro-economic funding for youth training and employments opportunities including tailor-made bespoke programmes;</li>\n<li>fiscal stimuli to encourage employers to employ young people;</li>\n<li>central responsibility and co-ordination to reduce NEET</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There has been a tendency for local strategies to focus on what activity Local Authorities, information, advice and guidance, and learning providers and young people themselves can do to address NEET. The research above suggests that there is a need to consider what local labour markets, employers and businesses can offer, for example, through local enterprise partnerships (LEPS) to support young people into EET and to address the significant mismatch between young people&#8217;s aspirations and the opportunities available. The focus needs to be on building links with the local labour market at a strategic level &#8211; to simplify and encourage opportunities for employees to work with young people, who are NEET, engage local employers in strategy development, support planning officers to work with employers to create opportunities, research the local issues leading to NEET and develop better targeted support. (Nelson and O&#8217;Donnell, 2012)</p>\n<p>There are a range of approaches needed to engage the different cohorts of young people who are NEET. Recent NFER research (Spielhofer et al.,2009<em>) </em>identified three discreet sub-categories of NEET young people aged 16-17 :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8216;Open to learning&#8217; &#8211; young people with high levels of attainments and positive attitudes towards school and learning and who are most likely to re-engage; need no or low level access to Information, Advice and Guidance.</li>\n<li>&#8216;Sustained&#8217; &#8211; young people who have had higher levels of truancy and exclusions and lower attainment and are most likely to remain long term NEET; who require high cost targeted support.</li>\n<li>&#8216;Undecided&#8217; &#8211; young people who have reasonable attainment levels but are dissatisfied with the available opportunities. This group need appropriate and timely IAG and help with focus and direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nelson and O&#8217;Donnell (2012) highlight that a well co-ordinated strategy for engagement or re-engagement, especially where young people have deeply entrenched barriers is needed to address NEET. Research undertaken by the Local Government Association and others (<a href=\"http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/11137/1/nat-raising_aspirations-re-24sep2009-v1-1.pdf\">GHK Consulting, 2009</a>) suggests a series of cross cutting issues to achieving engagement and reducing NEET percentages.</p>\n<h3>Reading&#8217;s Strategy for supporting NEET prevention/reduction</h3>\n<p>The development of the City Deal Strategy will inform and drive the overarching strategy for improving employment and skills outcomes in Reading. A key focus is on labour market interventions targeting young people (ages 16-24) with the objective to simplify pathways and systems to help deliver better outcomes.</p>\n<p>A revised NEET strategy will be developed in this context. The interim NEET plan&#8217;s primary aim was to reduce the number of young people Not in Education, Employment or Training in Reading and to support local and regional plans that Raise the Participation Age (RPA) to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015.</p>\n<p>It primarily focuses on 16-18 NEET, but has some cross over with regard to pre-16 and over 18 year old work. The strategy sets out five key aims, which Reading Borough Council and its partners endeavour to meet in order to achieve local NEET reduction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent NEET and act early on disengagement.</li>\n<li>Understand the cohort and ensure a focus on performance.</li>\n<li>Diversify and open up the learning offer with a focus on the most vulnerable.</li>\n<li>Strengthen partnership working.</li>\n<li>Ensure young people have access to good quality support when they need it most.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A broad range of activity is delivered in Reading to support young people into education, employment and training (EET) including. The multi-agency NEET</p>\n<p>Task Group&#8217;s role is to oversee the implementation of the local strategy.</p>\n<p>The provision for tracking and monitoring young people&#8217;s NEET/EET activity and careers information, guidance (IAG) and support for young people aged 16 &#8211; 19 who are NEET and vulnerable young people at risk of NEET is commissioned by the Local Authority and is provided by Adviza (formerly Connexions Berkshire). Other key activity includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raising Participation Partnership &#8211; work with schools, training providers and employers to prepare for the introduction of &#8216;Raising the Participation Age&#8217; by Central Government which requires that all 16 and 17 year olds and are either in education or training by 2013.</li>\n<li>Productive Pathways Project &#8211; Development of a virtual platform and Gateway portal for 16-24 year olds.</li>\n<li>Apprenticeship steering group.</li>\n<li>Careers Leads Group &#8211; Supports schools to deliver on quality IAG.</li>\n<li>Implementation of the RONI (Risk of NEET Indicator) to help schools target those most at risk.</li>\n<li>Post 16 Transition Group to provide pathways vulnerable young people into EET.</li>\n<li>Range of volunteer mentoring schemes; alternative learning and engagement activity delivered by a range of providers across Reading; work pairing at Reading College; delivery of the Youth Contract for a specific cohort of 16-17 year olds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Young carers</h3>\n<p>The Reading Young Carers Project is provided through Reading Borough Council and includes a weekly support group for carers of different ages (5-19 years) during term time. A Young Carers project screening tool has been developed which allows for assessment of the young carer in line with the Children and Families Act 2014 and takes a whole family approach to the needs of the young carer.</p>\n<p>Within the school nursing team in Reading, a School Nurse Champion for Young Carers has been identified and attended training as provided by the Carers Trust. The school nurse champion for young carers is working closely with schools and the young carers service in order to raise the profile of young carers and disseminating information and training about young carers to the rest of the school nursing team.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/299270/Young_Carers_pathway_Interactive_FINAL.pdf\">Young Carers Pathway</a> was launched in 2014 as a model approach for school nursing, education, local authorities and young carers service to work together. The pathway aims to provide a visible, accessible and confidential service for young carers, promoting partnership working and thereby promoting positive physical and emotional wellbeing for young carers. As school nursing teams are in a unique position to be able to offer support to young carers, the Department of Health has been training School Nurse Champions for Young Carers.</p>\n<p>The Carers Trust and The Children&#8217;s Society Young Carers in Focus partners have jointly developed the <a href=\"https://professionals.carers.org/stepbystep\">Young Carers in Schools</a> initiative across England, aiming to equip schools to support young carers and then awarding good practice. The step by step guide helps schools to identify and support young carers and the expert regional networks.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<h3>Child poverty</h3>\n<p>While Reading appears to have a similar proportion of children living in poverty as the national average and slightly higher than its neighbouring localities, analysis of data at ward, LSOA and school level suggest considerable differences amongst the local population and highlights areas around Whitley ward, Amersham Road, Northumberland Avenue, and Oxford Road where children appear to be much more likely to be living in poverty than elsewhere in the borough.</p>\n<h3>Looked After Children</h3>\n<p>The number of looked after children and young people can vary from month to month, as children and young people move in and out of the system. Younger children are more likely to become LAC as they are very vulnerable and need to be removed while the assessment process is undertaken (they can be placed with other family members). This enables more time for the social worker to work and assess the family and their behaviours as a whole.</p>\n<p>In March 2015, only 27% of LAC were in Reading Borough Council placements, excluding Family and Friends. The use of Fostering Agencies over the same period was 37%.</p>\n<p>As at the 31st March 2015, comparing the rate of LAC per 10,000 of the population, Reading was at the same rate as its statistical Neighbours and the England average (60 per 10,000), however this is higher than the South East rate which sat at 48.2 per 10,000.</p>\n<h3>NEET</h3>\n<p>There is a need to develop a clearer more robust and well co-ordinated strategy for Reading to address NEET. This needs to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A focus on building links with the local labour market at a strategic level to simplify and encourage opportunities for employees to work with young people and engage local employers in strategy development. The development of the City Deal will drive this.</li>\n<li>Communication processes to improve opportunities for NEET young people, raise awareness of the local offer, identify links between initiatives for vulnerable young people; enterprise development and employer support and involve local Information Advice and Guidance in schools.</li>\n<li>The development of an employment and skills gateway to create skills and opportunities for 16-24 year olds including a one stop shop for young people.</li>\n<li>A clear plan of the best practice approaches to address the needs of the three distinct sub-categories of NEET young people.</li>\n<li>A distinct plan to engage and reengage the long term NEET and those with entrenched barriers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a significant level of service and activity that will benefit from improved co- ordination. This combined with more robust outcomes focused delivery and monitoring will enable a more cohesive approach to improving EET and needs to be reflected in the strategy.</p>\n<h3>Young Carers</h3>\n<p>The young and young adult carers are distributed differently across Reading than older carers. This may have consequences for service provision. While most young carers are providing between 1-19 hours of unpaid care a week, over 10% are providing a high level of care (50+ hours a week). Young carers in Reading show a marked increase in poor health when compared to young people who are not providing unpaid care.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<h3>Child poverty</h3>\n<p>Reading Borough is characterised by extremes of wealth and poverty in a small geographic area and widely varying outcomes in terms of educational achievement, income, life expectancy, health and well-being and exposure to criminal activity. In many cases these impacts are inter-generational resulting in a cycle of deprivation passing from parents to children. Poverty is a key driver of these cycles and high levels of child poverty are a key consequence.</p>\n<h3>Looked after Children</h3>\n<p>The Looked After Children&#8217;s Sufficiency Statement Strategy 2015-2017 demonstrates how RBC plans to take steps that secure, as far as reasonably practicable, sufficient accommodation within the local authority area which meets the needs of children that the local authority is looking after. The lack of local placements in the Reading Borough Council area is demonstrated by the fact 33% of Looked After Children are placed more than 20 miles away from their home address. Whilst this may be a positive reason (such as children in adoptive placements or in specialist residential settings) this overall percentage figure is too high and must be reduced.</p>\n<p>It is important that children and young people live locally so that they can remain in contact with their family and community and retain stability in education provision and receive local health services.</p>\n<h3>NEET</h3>\n<p>There are specific cohorts of young people who are more likely to become NEET. In Reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The numbers fluctuate, but over 40% of teenage parents were NEET in Reading during 2012/13.</li>\n<li>The target for young people with Learning Difficulties or Disabilities (LDD) to Education, Employment or Training (EET) ages 16-24 is 70%. The figure in Reading has consistently exceeded in 80%.</li>\n<li>There are disproportionately high percentages of young people who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) in Whitley, Church and Abbey Wards. In May 2013, 17% of the NEET cohort resided in Reading.</li>\n<li>The BME / NEET data has not shown consistent themes in the last two years.</li>\n<li>The tendency is for white young men and Black and White Caribbean young men to be overrepresented in the NEET Cohort.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<h3>Child poverty</h3>\n<p>The risks of poverty, material deprivation and wider disadvantage are much higher in families where no one works. For a child in a workless household, the risk of being in relative poverty (59%) is far higher than the risk for children in families where all adults work (8%) (Child Poverty Needs Assessment Toolkit).</p>\n<p>Despite an unemployment rate below the national average, Reading continues to have pockets of structural unemployment in a predominantly high growth economy. This potentially puts Reading in a much stronger position to have a positive impact than many other parts of the country. This is associated with under achievement and low skill levels that also drive a more widespread issue of low income amongst the employed. So whilst work may be the best route out of poverty it is not of itself necessarily sufficient.</p>\n<p>Of particular concern in the current climate are opportunities for young people and the prospects for lone parents.</p>\n<h3>NEET</h3>\n<p>The monitoring of outcomes for young care leavers and young carers needs to be improved. Recent measures to improve the sharing of information and links between the Local Authority and Adviza for these 2 cohorts are seeking to address this.</p>\n<h3>Young Carers</h3>\n<p>The Family Action Report in 2012 &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.family-action.org.uk/content/uploads/2014/06/Be-Bothered-Make-Education-Count-for-Young-Carers.pdf\">Be Bothered! Making education count for young carers</a>&#8221; highlighted gaps in awareness and recognition of the extra needs of young carers at school with only 44% of responding teachers stating their school did an adequate or good job supporting young carers. In addition, 49% of young carers stated that their school work had been affected by being a young carer. Identification is key as without the appropriate support, young carers have significantly lower educational attainment at GCSE level that their peers and are more likely than the national average to be not in education, employment or training (NEET) between the ages of 16 and 19 years <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/tcs/report_hidden-from-view_young-carers_final.pdf\">(Hidden from View, 2013)</a>.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/deprivation-by-ward-and-lower-super-output-area/\">Deprivation by Ward and Lower Super Output Area</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/employment/\">Employment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/crime/\">Crime</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/safeguarding-children/\">Safeguarding children</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) (2016).

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Social and emotional wellbeing refers equally to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotional wellbeing (e.g. feeling happy and confident)</li>\n<li>Psychological wellbeing (e.g. feeling in control of one&#8217;s life, being resilient, and displaying assertiveness)</li>\n<li>Social wellbeing (e.g. the ability to have good relationships with family and friends)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children&#8217;s social and emotional wellbeing is not only important in its own right, but also a contributor to good physical health and as a factor in determining how well they do at school <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph12\">(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2008)</a></p>\n<p>The importance of social and emotional wellbeing in the early years of a child&#8217;s life in relation to a healthy development is described in &#8216;Supporting Families in the foundation years&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/184868/DFE-01001-2011_supporting_families_in_the_foundation_years.pdf\">(Department for Education and Department of Health, 2011)</a>. The social and emotional wellbeing of older children, particularly during the transition from adolescence to adulthood, is of equal importance to future wellbeing. However, the challenges occurring during adolescence are often less acknowledged and understood than those occurring during the early years <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/what-we-do/resources-and-publications/seriously-awkward-how-vulnerable-16-and-17-year-olds-are\">(Pona, Royston, Bracey, &amp; Gibbs, 2015)</a>.</p>\n<p>Although anyone can have poor social and emotional wellbeing, it is well evidenced that certain population groups are more likely to suffer from poor wellbeing and have mental health problems. Those children who do develop mental health problems will need additional timely treatment from the appropriate mental health service, supported by the wider services around the child. There is now an increasing emphasis on the need to support the social and emotional wellbeing of the wider population of children and young people, and the need for a clearer distinction between mental health treatment and emotional wellbeing support (Wolpert, et al., 2014).</p>\n<p>The report of the government&#8217;s Children and Young People&#8217;s Mental Health Taskforce, &#8220;Future in mind &#8211; promoting, protecting and improving our children and young people&#8217;s mental health and wellbeing&#8221;  <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/414024/Childrens_Mental_Health.pdf\">(DoH, 2015)</a> was launched in March, 2015. It provides a broad set of recommendations across comprehensive CAMHS that, if implemented, would facilitate greater access and standards for CAMHS services, promote positive mental health and wellbeing for children and young people, greater system co-ordination and a significant improvement in meeting the mental health needs of children and young people from vulnerable backgrounds.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Statistics about mental health are published by <a href=\"http://www.youngminds.org.uk/\">Young Minds</a>, a charity committed to improving the emotional wellbeing and mental health of children and young people. These illustrate why ensuring early support is essential.</p>\n<p>There has also been an increased emphasis place on the importance of Public Mental Health which involves the assessment of the local need and the delivery of mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention initiatives. There is good evidence for a number of public mental health interventions which are shown to provide significant economic savings <a href=\"http://www.jcpmh.info/wp-content/uploads/jcpmh-publicmentalhealth-guide.pdf\">(Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health, 2013)</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Table 1: Savings for every £1 invested in Public Mental Health services</strong></p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table class=\"bluegeneral\" summary=\"Savings for every £1 invested in Public Mental Health services\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluetopleft\">Savings (£s)</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopright\">Intervention</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">84</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">School-based social and emotional learning programmes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">18</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">Early intervention for psychosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">14</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">School-based interventions to reduce bullying</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">10</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">Early intervention for pre-psychosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">Early interventions for parents of children with conduct disorder</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jcpmh.info/wp-content/uploads/jcpmh-publicmentalhealth-guide.pdf\">(Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health, 2013)</a></p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>Data relating to Child and Adolescent Mental Health are available from a range of sources. The <a href=\"http://www.chimat.org.uk/\">Child and Maternal Health Intelligence Network</a> (ChiMat) publishes estimates of the numbers of children with different mental health conditions in Local Authority areas. These are calculated by applying estimated prevalence to local population size and therefore acknowledged to be approximations only. Public Health England (PHE) has a profiling tool that provides a range of information linked to <a href=\"http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile-group/mental-health/profile/cypmh\">Children&#8217;s and Young People&#8217;s Mental Health and Wellbeing</a>. As with ChiMat, caution should be used as some of the data are estimates and maybe not as robust as we would like.</p>\n<p>Figures show that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2013, 1,902 (9.1%) children aged 5-16 living in Reading are estimated to have a mental health disorder. This is higher than the average in the South East (8.5%) but lower and the England average (9.6%). Conditions will include emotional, conduct, hyperkinetic, attachment and eating disorders, as well as substance misuse problems.</li>\n<li>In 2012/13 there were 762 referrals received by the local mental health trust, of which, 586 were appropriate to a response from Reading CAMHS tier 3 and 4 services. The majority (66%) of these referrals came from primary health care. 22% of referrals were waiting over 18 weeks for a first appointment. 9% of cases did not attend their appointment.</li>\n<li>In 2013/14 the number of 5 to 19 year olds in treatment with mental health disorder in Berkshire increased by 17.5% to 4,214.</li>\n<li>In 2013/14 the total number of Deliberate Self Harm cases (DSH) increased by 52% to 76</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Table 2 below shows more information on the prevalence of mental health issues for Reading compared to the South East and England averages.</p>\n<p><strong>Table 2: Current mental health prevalence</strong></p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table class=\"bluegeneral\" summary=\"Current mental health prevalence\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluetopleft\"><strong>Indicator</strong></td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\"><strong>Reading</strong></td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\"><strong>South East</strong></td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\"><strong>England</strong></td>\n<td class=\"bluetopright\"><strong>Year</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Perinatal mental health: Estimated number of women requiring support during pregnancy or postnatal period</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">326</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">N/A</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">N/A</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">2012</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Estimated prevalence of any mental health disorder: % population aged 5-16</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">9.0%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">8.5%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">9.3%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Estimated prevalence of emotional disorders: % population aged 5-16</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.5%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.3%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.6%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Estimated prevalence of conduct disorders: % population aged 5-16</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">5.5%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">5.1%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">5.6%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Estimated prevalence of hyperkinetic disorders: % population aged 5-16</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">1.5%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">1.4%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">1.5%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Prevalence of potential eating disorders among young people: Estimated number of 16 &#8211;

council, assessed 163 children in 2014/15. 52% of these children were passed on by the Common Point of Entry service that Berkshire Healthcare Foundation Trust (BHFT) operates as the front door to CAMHS services, with the remainder being referred from local Reading services, e.g. schools, social workers, GPs. Of the 163 children that were assessed by a PMHW, 41% received a direct therapeutic intervention by the PMHW service. The remainder were signposted to alternative community services, such as: Tier 3 CAMHS, parenting, youth work, youth counselling, etc.</p>\n<p>Reading Educational Psychology service are often the first professional service that Schools, Children&#8217;s Centres and other settings will take their concerns to about children&#8217;s emotional health and wellbeing issues. Importantly, the service also has a key role to play in the statutory assessment of Special Educational Needs for Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC Plans). In Reading Autistic-Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a growing primary reason for active statements and EHC Plans. In 2014 there were 216 cases with a statement for ASD, a rise of 30 from 2013. For Behavioural, Social and Emotional Development, as the primary reason of active statements, there were 586 cases in 2014, a slight rise from 2013, when there were 579 cases <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-special-educational-needs-sen\">(DfE, 2016)</a>.

Work needs to be done to ensure that as many young people who may need support are identified.</p>\n<p>Children and young people who are living in more deprived areas, are disadvantaged, have vulnerable backgrounds or maybe living a chaotic lifestyle are more likely to have mental health issues.</p>\n<p>Looked after children (LAC) have a higher risk of mental health problems. Continued use of the SDQ assessment tool for LAC is essential to identify and plan appropriate support for young people who need it.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>There is good evidence for a number of public mental health interventions which are shown to provide significant economic savings and these need to be further utilised by local areas.</p>\n<p>In July 2015, a Children&#8217;s Trust workshop suggested the need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineer a new model of delivery that tackles access and prevents young people being lost in the system.</li>\n<li>Invest in our staff and workforce, strengthening the working culture and level of support at all levels of service delivery, but in schools in particular.</li>\n<li>Build a stronger Early Intervention offer that builds the resilience in children and young people and providing support as early as possible.</li>\n<li>Include families in the support process as well as include peers and friends in supporting the delivery of services, particularly to help young people feel and think differently about mental health issues, achieving less fear, stigma and discrimination.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following are also in place to promote and address children and young people&#8217;s mental health in Reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Berkshire Autism Society run various activities for children and young that include; trampolining sessions, swimming sessions, Lego clubs, a games club and visits to Thames Valley Adventure playground.</li>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Trust are looking at emotional wellbeing as a partnership priority area of work.</li>\n<li>Perinatal mental health services.</li>\n<li>Oxford Parent Infant Project (OXPIP)</li>\n<li>ADHD clinics in Whitley Park School</li>\n<li>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire project and Young Peoples Mental Health</li>\n<li>Reading Borough Council financially supported youth counselling service (Adviza).</li>\n<li>CCG funded voluntary sector services via their grants scheme</li>\n<li>Educational Psychologists (EP) therapeutic work in schools</li>\n<li>Specialist parenting programmes for children and young people whose parents have Social Emotional &amp; Mental Health Difficulties (SEMHD) which affect parenting: &#8216;Just What we Need&#8217;, &#8216;Mellow Parenting&#8217;; Voluntary sector (Special Parenting) run specialist parenting and support groups for ADHD and with ASD are run by voluntary sector.</li>\n<li>Mental Health training in schools includes:  Psychological First Aid training</li>\n<li>Public Health funded a Help line following leaflets on Mental Health been distributed in schools.</li>\n<li>Community eating disorders services are being expanded by BHFT.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Primary Mental Health Worker Recommendations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In line with the &#8216;Future in Mind&#8217; government document <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/414024/Childrens_Mental_Health.pdf\">(DoH, 2015)</a>, in order to make effective changes happen local services need to:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Place the emphasis on building resilience, promoting good mental health, prevention and early intervention</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplify structures and improve access</strong>: by dismantling artificial barriers between services by making sure that those bodies that plan and pay for services work together, and ensuring that children and young people have easy access to the right support from the right service.</li>\n<li><strong>Deliver a clear joined up approach</strong>: linking services so care pathways are easier to navigate for all children and young people, including those who are most vulnerable, so people do not fall between gaps.</li>\n<li><strong>Harness the power of information</strong>: to drive improvements in the delivery of care, and standards of performance, and ensure we have a much better understanding of how to get the best outcomes for children, young people and families/carers and value from our investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Sustain a culture of continuous evidence-based service improvement</strong> delivered by a workforce with the right mix of skills, competencies and experience</li>\n<li><strong>Make the right investments</strong>: to be clear about how resources are being used in each area, what is being spent, and to equip all those who plan and pay for services for their local population with the evidence they need to make good investment decisions in partnerships with children and young people, their families and professionals. Such an approach will also enable better judgements to be made about the overall adequacy of investment</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>RBC should have a Mental Health Strategy. Primary Mental Health Workers and Educational Psychologists are central to the emotional and well-being work that goes on in Reading, Educational Psychologists therefore they are ideally suited to contribute to the development of a coherent strategy. We recommend, therefore, that they are represented at any discussion of this nature.</li>\n<li>Encourage positive mental health in our schools and colleges. Resilience training across Reading Borough Council linked to preventative work on how to be emotionally well. This could be put together as a strategy across RBC, which would use existing services to provide a substantive and planned preventative work. This would reduce the need for crisis work further down the line. EPs are working with PMHW colleagues in the development of a resilience programme which can be reported back on and developed as needed across Reading schools/colleges. This links to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/414024/Childrens_Mental_Health.pdf\">&#8216;Future in mind: promoting and improving our children and young people&#8217;s mental health and wellbeing&#8217; (DoH, 2015).</a></li>\n<li><em>&#8216;To build a stronger awareness in Reading&#8217;s secondary schools around understanding, identifying and talking about emotional health and well-being issues, covering areas such as attachment difficulties, bullying and self-harm&#8217;</em>. It is recommended that:\n<ul>\n<li>There is expansion of a tiered package of Emotional First Aid training in schools to raise awareness and confidence of staff working in schools to recognise and respond to children and young people with MH issues. PMHW and EPs to all be trained in EFA to improve delivery to schools.</li>\n<li>Joint &#8216;surgeries&#8217; are held in schools by EPs and PMHWs to allow staff and pupils to access an information and advice on MH, and to provide a safe reflective space for staff to think about how best to support CYP with MH issues in their classes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The earlier interventions happen the more likely it is that people can be resilient at difficult points in their lives. Early intervention is happening in children&#8217;s centres e.g. OXPIP and family support. This can be further developed and improved through increased recognition of these services and data analysis of the effectiveness, alongside increased communication between services. We would like to see other MH professionals working out of Children&#8217;s Centres and schools in order to allow a greater access of service to parents with young children, and to further reduce the stigma associated with MH. Further evidence based programmes of intervention to support attachment between parent and child to avoid trauma and build resilience and improve behaviour. With additional funding this can be delivered in Children&#8217;s Centres by existing maternal, perinatal and early years health services and parenting programmes.</li>\n<li>Create MH hubs in schools &#8211; training package offered by PMHW and EPs in schools to all staff and parents. Offer parenting information sessions in schools on MH e.g. coffee morning in schools with parents on MH and resilience. Voluntary sector involvement; other practitioners could attend for clinics in the schools. These could be seen as one-stop shops to make MH services visible and accessible to CYP and families.</li>\n<li>Agree a standard of CYP being seen within 6 weeks for IAPT (as Adults standard)</li>\n<li>Specialist services for CYP who have experienced trauma and in particular sexual abuse. PMHWs are trained for this work but are under-resourced both in terms of their own team and the team around them. The suggestion is that SA work should have a virtual team that can work with the individual and their family system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/social-and-environmental-context/\">Social &amp; Environmental Context</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/long-term-conditions-in-children-and-young-people/\">Long Term Conditions in Children &amp; Young People</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/carers/\">Carers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/safeguarding-children/\">Safeguarding children</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/school-life/\">School life</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/jsna/young-offenders\">Young Offenders</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/jsna/gypsies-travellers\">Gypsies &amp; Travellers</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Department for Education and Department of Health.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) is a form of child sexual abuse. It is complex and can manifest itself in different ways.</p>\n<p>The current agreed definition of CSE &#8220;involves exploitative situations, contexts and relationships where young people (or a third person or persons) receive &#8216;something&#8217; (for example: food, accommodation, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, affection, gifts, money) as a result of them performing, and/or another or others performing on them, sexual activities. CSE can occur through the use of technology without the child&#8217;s immediate recognition; for example being persuaded to post sexual images on the Internet/mobile phones without immediate payment or gain. In all cases, those exploiting the child/young person have power over them by virtue of their age, gender, intellect, physical strength and/or economic or other resources. Violence, coercion and intimidation are common, involvement in exploitative relationships being characterised in the main by the child or young person&#8217;s limited availability of choice resulting from their social/economic and/or emotional vulnerability.&#8221; (HM Government, 2012).</p>\n<p>There is currently an ongoing consultation in to the Definition of CSE and the final definition will be published Spring 2016. The proposed new definition is:</p>\n<p><em>Child sexual exploitation is a form of child abuse. It occurs where anyone under the age of 18 is persuaded, coerced or forced into sexual activity in exchange for, amongst other things, money, drugs/alcohol, gifts, affection or status. Consent is irrelevant, even where a child may believe they are voluntarily engaging in sexual activity with the person who is exploiting them. Child sexual exploitation does not always involve physical contact and may occur online.&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>As with all types of abuse, CSE can have a devastating impact on the child or young person who is being exploited. It can disrupt their social lives and education, and cause long-term mental health problems including self-harm, attempts at suicide, and relationship behaviours which can affect achieving a fulfilling life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-child-sexual-exploitation--2\">HM Government, 2015a</a> stated that tackling child sexual abuse was a national priority.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Recent trials and serious case reviews have shown that CSE is not isolated to one or two areas. In the past, children have been let down by services. There are also growing concerns and awareness of online grooming and incidents of &#8216;peer on peer&#8217; sexual exploitation, whereby minors are sexually exploited by their contemporaries. Nationally, the focus is on combating perpetrators operating; &#8216;that is adult men seeking to groom, opportunistically exploit or systematically control children for sex, often committing rape and other serious sexual violence&#8217; (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/418394/Louise_Casey_report_into_CSE_template_format__4_.pdf\">Department of Communities and Local Government, 2015</a>). In her report Louise Casey made four points relating to CSE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSE is child abuse and a crime. We need to focus on perpetrators to detect, prevent and disrupt at the earliest stage. Subsequently, offenders should be prosecuted and face the full force of the criminal justice system.</li>\n<li>Victims are children, however they present themselves. They cannot give consent and there is no scenario in which victims should be considered as young women or as making choices.</li>\n<li>CSE is a <strong>community safety </strong>issue and the partnership need to use community safety tactics and action to keep children safe.</li>\n<li>We need to seek out sexual exploitation and not fear what we find</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CSE has had a higher profile in recent years, due to the widely publicised cases in Rochdale, Rotherham and Oxfordshire. Separate independent reviews for these cases highlighted that organised CSE had &#8220;been happening on a massive scale over many years&#8221; and that &#8220;local agencies had dismissed concerns or put in place an adequate response&#8221; (<a href=\"http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham\">Jay, A., 2013</a>). It is clear that CSE has been an issue for other local authorities, although these have not been subject to the same media coverage.</p>\n<p>CSE is a hidden crime. It can be difficult to identify victims, as children and young people rarely disclose abuse through sexual exploitation due to a number of complex factors. For example, children not being aware that they are being abused, fear and shame and feeling &#8216;in love&#8217; with the perpetrator(s).</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>Evidence submitted to the <a href=\"https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/publication/if-only-someone-had-listened/\">Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Gangs and Groups</a> indicated that over 16,500 children and young people in England were at high risk of CSE in 2010/11. 2,409 children were confirmed as victims over this period, although this was recognised as an under-estimation of the true number of victims.</p>\n<p>The Inquiry&#8217;s findings showed that victims of CSE were both male and female, and a range of ages, ethnicities and sexualities. Of the 2,408 victims identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ages ranged between 4 and 19 years old, with a peak age of 15.</li>\n<li>Majority were girls.</li>\n<li>Higher rate of victimisation of children from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups. 28% of all victims identified were from a BME group, which is an over-representation of England&#8217;s population.</li>\n<li>155 were also identified as being perpetrators of CSE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Inquiry explained that the characteristics common to all victims were &#8220;their powerlessness and vulnerability&#8221;, rather than a particular demographic. However, while it is acknowledged that &#8220;children from loving and secure home can be abused&#8230;those for whom there are no protective measures in place are at greatest risk&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In a recently published report by <a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/old-enough-to-know-better\">The Children&#8217;s Society</a> (2015) it was stated that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An estimated 50,000 16 and 17 year old girls reported having experienced a sexual offence in the previous 12 months (based on analysis of Crime Survey for England and Wales data)</li>\n<li>An estimated 4,900 16 and 17 year olds reported a sexual offence to the police in England in the past 12 months</li>\n<li>An estimated 890 of the reported sexual offences against 16 to 17 year olds where someone was charged or received a summons or community disposal</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Child Sexual Exploitation &#8211; SEMRAC data</h2>\n<p>Local data is monitored through the Sexual Exploitation and Missing Risk Assessment Conference (SEMRAC) to assess the level of CSE risk for those young people referred by MASH (Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub), which has been running since August 2014. This gives an early indication of known prevalence. Case numbers and risk levels are reviewed monthly.</p>\n<p>The chart below in figure 1 shows the number of young people and their designated risk level that are active cases at each SEMRAC. It should be noted that the same young person will feature at a number of meetings.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Active cases at SEMRAC, Oct 2014 &#8211; May 2015</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4864/image1/image/image1_1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></strong></p>\n<p>Source: Reading Borough Council</p>\n<p>SEMRAC reviews the referred young people and considers the level of risk at each meeting until the risk is reduced below level 1.</p>\n<p>SEMRAC has been recording the levels of risk since August 2014, to date 21 young people have reduced their level of risk, 13 of these young people are no longer on the SEMRAC list.  A further 10 young people remained at the same level of risk whilst for 7 young people their level of risk has been increased</p>\n<p>As of the 25<sup>th</sup> February 2016 there are 13 young people who have a designated level of risk in SEMRAC, there are a further 3 children that will be discussed and risk level determined at the next SEMRAC.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<h2>National Strategies</h2>\n<p>Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, including keeping children safe from sexual exploitation, is a key part of the Government&#8217;s drive to improve outcomes for children and young people.  All agencies providing services to children have a statutory duty under Section 11 of the Children&#8217;s Act 2004 to understand the risks and ways in which children can be exploited sexually and the ways in which their agencies can safeguard them against this.</p>\n<p>This is underpinned by a number of key national strategies and policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HM Government (2015b); <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2\">Working Together to Safeguard Children</a>  &#8211; the revised core Government guidance which sets out how organisations and individuals should work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children</li>\n<li>Department for Children, Schools and Families (2008); <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100202100514/http:/dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/resources-and-practice/ig00312/\">The Staying Safe Action Plan</a> (Archived).</li>\n<li>Department of Health (2009); <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/DH_094400\">Healthy lives, brighter futures: The strategy for children and young people&#8217;s health</a> &#8211; sets out the Government&#8217;s long-term strategy to support children&#8217;s and families&#8217; health including a commitment to ensure that all organisations with responsibility for child health and wellbeing are fulfilling their statutory responsibilities for safeguarding children (Archived).</li>\n<li>HM Government (2012); Safeguarding Children and Young People from Sexual Exploitation this national guidance supplements &#8216;Working together to Safeguard Children  and is aimed at local safeguarding children&#8217;s boards, practitioners and professionals working with children and young people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the independent review of CSE in Rotherham, the Government published a report to set out additional steps in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-child-sexual-exploitation--2\">Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation</a> (2015a). The actions highlighted in the report included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a new whistleblowing national portal for child abuse, which will spot patterns of failure across the country</li>\n<li>consulting on an extension to the new &#8220;wilful neglect&#8221; offence to children&#8217;s social care, education and elected members</li>\n<li>raising the status of child sexual abuse to a &#8220;national threat&#8221; in the Strategic Policing Requirement so that it is prioritised by every police force</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accountability and leadership at a local level was also highlighted in the report. While Central Government will lead the national response, it states that &#8220;local authorities, police, children&#8217;s and health services have a statutory duty to work together to identify and stamp it out in their area. Communities must help to tackle the problem, rather than assume victims bring it on themselves.&#8221; There will therefore be an expectation that all Local Safeguarding Children Boards will conduct regular local assessments on the effectiveness of local responses to CSE and publish the outcome of those assessments through their annual reports. Government data collections will also be improved to include data on the prevalence of child sexual abuse, so that the performance of local areas is more transparent to the communities they serve.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/package-child-protection-advice-and-guidance-published\">Local Government Association</a> has also produced a resource pack for local authorities to use when planning work locally.</p>\n<h2>Local procedures and arrangements</h2>\n<p>In 2015, Reading&#8217;s Local Safeguarding Children&#8217;s Board published a 3-year strategy to <a href=\"http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAzADAANgAzAHwAfABGAGEAbABzAGUAfAB8ADMANgB8AA2\">Safeguard Children and Young People at Risk of or Experiencing Sexual Exploitation in Reading (2014-2017)</a>. This strategy builds on the progress that has already been made in Reading to ensure that we are effective in preventing CSE from happening, protecting those who may be at risk, pursuing and disrupting those who may pose a risk to children and ensuring victims of CSE are supported in their recovery.</p>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Local Safeguarding Children&#8217;s Board has already:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up a CSE and Missing Children&#8217;s Steering Group, which reports to the Local Safeguarding Childrens Board (LSCB). This is chaired by the Director of Education &amp; Early Help Services.</li>\n<li>Established a CSE and Missing Children Operational Group. This has strong multi-agency support led by Reading Borough Council and Thames Valley Police.</li>\n<li>Identified CSE champions across Reading Borough Council</li>\n<li>Made significant investment in training professionals through single and multi-agency training at universal, targeted and specialist levels</li>\n<li>Delivered bespoke training to frontline practitioners on sharing intelligence with the police</li>\n<li>Funded performances of &#8216;Chelsea&#8217;s Choice&#8217; for nine secondary schools in Reading, as part of an educational/preventative programme. This reached approximately 2,000 young people</li>\n<li>Completed an ongoing investigation pursuing those who have harmed or present a CSE risk to children.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also a number of established services to support victims of CSE including counselling service, CSE champions, Source Young People&#8217;s Drug &amp; Alcohol Team, Health drop-ins, Youth Outreach Nurse, Targeted Youth Support and the Barnardos U-Turn CSE Service..</p>\n<p>Local procedures for CSE are included in the <a href=\"http://www.proceduresonline.com/Berks/\">Berkshire Local Safeguarding Children Boards Child Protection procedures</a>. These provide guidance for practitioners who may encounter children and young people who are affected by sexual exploitation, either by being at risk or by actively being sexually exploited.  These procedures are written in accordance with the Government guidance contained within Safeguarding Children and Young People from Sexual Exploitation.</p>\n<p>The single point of contact within Thames Valley Police and Reading Children&#8217;s Social Care ensures there is a timely and assured response to any concerns, whether these are related to known, suspected or unconfirmed CSE events. The close working between the police, Children&#8217;s Social Care and other agencies ensures intelligence about hotspots is promptly shared. Thames Valley Police covers the local authority area and the whole of Berkshire which enables them to ensure a level of consistency in decision making and responses to CSE referrals and issues.</p>\n<p>In March 2015, Thames Valley Police announced that they were providing training to 13 hostels and Bed &amp; Breakfasts in the Reading area on how to spot the signs of CSE. This training has been put in place following the independent review into CSE in Oxfordshire, which stated that more could have been done to spot signs of CSE earlier. The training informs staff of what to do if they think CSE is taking place in their premises and how to spot possible signs. Thames Valley Police will also provide similar training to fast-food premises and have contacted establishments in the Reading area to offer support. Further information from Thames Valley Police can be found on their <a href=\"https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/\">website</a>.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Child Sexual Exploitation cannot be dealt with solely by individual local authorities, police divisions or public health authorities each operating in their own silos. Offenders and victims cross administrative boundaries and so should the collective response of the Local Safeguarding Children&#8217;s Board to safeguard the children of Reading.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Any child or young person may be at risk of sexual exploitation, regardless of their family background or other circumstances. However, there are strong links between children involved in sexual exploitation and other behaviours such as going missing from home or care, bullying, self-harm, teenage pregnancy, truancy and substance misuse. In addition, some children are particularly vulnerable, for example, children with special needs, those in residential or foster care, those leaving care, migrant children, unaccompanied asylum seeking children, and those involved in groups and/or gangs.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner (2012) outlined a list of key signs that may indicate that a child or young person is vulnerable to sexual exploitation. The Local Safeguarding Children Board&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAzADIANwA2AHwAfABGAGEAbABzAGUAfAB8ADMANgB8AA2\">CSE Indicator Tool</a> demonstrates a comprehensive list of indicators and is a tool to aid referrals to Children&#8217;s Social Care.</p>\n<p>The communities that residents live in, and the services and infrastructure that surround them, influence their everyday experience and quality of life. We know that there is a significant disparity of affluence and poverty across Reading&#8217;s neighbourhoods and that this pattern has persisted for years. What is more sobering is that we are having little impact on narrowing the gap on a range of outcomes for people in these neighbourhoods. We also know that historically service quality and provision has tended to be greater in more affluent areas of the Borough, from provision of health services to the quality of open-space. This need not necessarily be the case.</p>\n<p>There is also an increasing evidence base that some of the most transformative services for vulnerable groups are developed and delivered within local communities themselves and through grassroots-led approaches. Potentially a key element in securing better outcomes and more sustainable communities is to transform the way in which we work with local people.</p>\n<h2>Action involves</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8216;Turnaround Families&#8217;: Reconfiguration of family support services to better meet the needs of vulnerable families in particular.</li>\n<li>Working Better with you: development of new approaches to working with residents and communities.  Including a pilot project with the support of the Local Government Association to look at new models of neighbourhood working.</li>\n<li>Workforce development to better understand and respond to the impacts of poverty across different services and agencies, including models of community led change.</li>\n<li>Building on our Thriving Neighbourhoods work to target capacity and resources at our more deprived neighbourhoods and to develop more integrated working in these localities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</h2>\n<p>Reading LSCB has a <a href=\"http://www.readinglscb.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAzADAANgAzAHwAfABGAGEAbABzAGUAfAB8ADMANgB8AA2\">CSE strategy</a> in place. The partnership is committed to:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prevent:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Child Sexual Exploitation takes place within our community. We must raise awareness and understanding of CSE in order to prevent children from becoming victims.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Protect:</em></strong></p>\n<p>We will work together to identify children at risk of, or subject to sexual exploitation, so that we can safeguard and support them and prevent further harm. It is important that professionals, public, families and children understand the many forms of CSE so that they are better able to protect children and not miss signs.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pursue and Disrupt:</em></strong></p>\n<p>We will work together to assist in bringing offenders to justice and disrupt behaviour, whilst ensuring that children and young people are not subject to further risk and harm</p>\n<p><strong><em>Recovery:                         </em></strong></p>\n<p>We will ensure that victims of CSE are provided with the necessary support to aid their recovery. This support needs to be delivered in such a way that we do the right thing, in the right way and at the right time to aid their recovery. Recovery should also include the provision of services to enable them to reach their potential and reduce the likelihood of needing support services in the future.</p>\n<p>The CSE strategy contains an action plan to deliver on the above.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/safeguarding-children/\">Safeguarding children</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/sexual-health/\">Sexual Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/\">Children &amp; Adolescent Mental Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/crime/\">Crime</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/carers/\">Carers</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Berelowitz, S. et al., 2013. <em>&#8220;If only someone had listened&#8221; The Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner&#8217;s Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Gangs and Groups Final Report. </em>London: Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner.</p>\n<p>Children&#8217;s Society, The, 2015. <em>Old enough to know better?

    "excerpt": "<p>Introduction Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) is a form of child sexual abuse. It is complex and can manifest itself in different ways. The current agreed definition of CSE &#8220;involves exploitative situations, contexts and relationships where young people (or a third person or persons) receive &#8216;something&#8217; (for example: food, accommodation, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, affection, gifts, money) [&hellip;]</p>\n"

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The child development check at 2-2.5 years is the final developmental check undertaken by the health visiting (HV) service before a child enters school at either 2-3 years (if they are eligible for an early school place) or at the age of 4-5 years. This is part of the mandated checks that health visitors provide to all children and gives an ideal opportunity for the health visiting service to assess the child in the context of the whole family and identify any needs or risks.</p>\n<p>The 2-2.5 year development check is assessed through the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3 (ASQ-3). This is an assessment tool that helps parents and provides information about the developmental status of their child across five areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>communication</li>\n<li>gross motor skills</li>\n<li>fine motor skills</li>\n<li>problem solving</li>\n<li>personal-social</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The total scores from the ASQ-3 are used to shape further referrals and access to early help partners if required.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The results of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) (DoH, 2015) are not yet available at a local level, and cannot be generalised until full coverage is achieved. This has recently been achieved in the Berkshire area.</p>\n<p>From October 2015 the results of the Ages and Stages questionnaire will be reported within the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/392384/FACTSHEET.pdf\">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> (PHOF). This will indicate the percentage of 2-2.5 year olds who take up the offer of an assessment and the percentage of those that have a valid ASQ-3 completed. This information will be published at a national and local level. The increased ability to offer a universal screening programme will enable the mapping of needs and risks of poorer outcomes, which will provide a baseline for the development of targeted services in future.</p>\n<p>The PHOF also includes a measure of the next age specific assessment at 4-5 years old when a child enters school. The requirement to offer increased access to high quality early years schooling, means that there is a potential overlap between the two measures. Joint training is therefore required to ensure that there is a consistent interpretation of the &#8216;good communication&#8217; score and the personal social and emotional development scores in each.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>In the absence of locality level outcomes for the 2-2.5 year check it is important to note what they are used for.</p>\n<p>The results of the check should inform work with eligible children&#8217;s parents to improve their child&#8217;s readiness for school. School readiness is measured by the Early Year&#8217;s Foundation Stage (EYFS) attainment profile.</p>\n<p>PHOF profiles based on 2014/15 data showed that the Reading average (67.1%) for the percentage of children achieving a good level of development at the end of reception was <strong>better</strong> than other local authorities matched on levels of deprivation. Reading&#8217;s average was also <strong>higher</strong> when compared to the England average of 66.3%. The chart below shows that school readiness levels has consistently been improving over recent years.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: School readiness; achieving a good level of development (Reading and England 2012/13 to 2014/15)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4863/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework</p>\n<p>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</p>\n<p>The evidence base for the Healthy Child programme 0-5 (DH 2009) can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-child-programme-pregnancy-and-the-first-5-years-of-life\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-child-programme-pregnancy-and-the-first-5-years-of-life</a> and a rapid review to update the evidence contained within it can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-child-programme-rapid-review-to-update-evidence\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-child-programme-rapid-review-to-update-evidence</a>.</p>\n<p>The Wave Trust (2012) published an evidence based framework for commissioning prevention programmes to optimise child development at the age of two years. The areas of impact are; assessing maternal mental health in pregnancy, developing secure attachment, offering specialist parent- infant psychotherapy support, identifying risk factors during pregnancy, assessing social and emotional development and offering early help and support, reducing domestic violence, improving parenting capability, improving multi agency working and workforce capacity.</p>\n<p>NHS England have commissioned an increased health visiting workforce and has published the 2015-16 national service specification for health visiting. This contains the full evidence base for the 0-5 healthy child programme.</p>\n<p>Public Health England (PHE) promotes integrated two year reviews where the children is in an early years setting which aim to bring together the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Progress Check at age two with the Healthy Child Programme (HCP) 2-2½ year health and development review. PHE has published the six high impact areas for commissioning public health programmes for children aged 0-5. These can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commissioning-of-public-health-services-for-children\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commissioning-of-public-health-services-for-children</a>. The high impact areas include the integrated two year review alongside; the transition to parenthood and the early weeks, maternal mental health, breastfeeding, healthy weight and healthy nutrition, and managing minor illnesses and reducing accidents.</p>\n<p>A review of the pilot into integrated reviews can be found here <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/376698/DFE-RR350_Integrated_review_at_age_two_implementation_study.pdf\">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/376698/DFE-RR350_Integrated_review_at_age_two_implementation_study.pdf</a></p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>If a child does not receive a good start in life then it can impact on their health and wellbeing for life. Brain development at the age of three is enhanced by sensitive attuned parenting and promoting secure attachment. Parental skills and confidence can be affected by a range of risk factors which also affect the child&#8217;s social and emotional and behavioural outcomes.</p>\n<p>Early detection of physical development delays is as important as the assessment of child emotional and social development.</p>\n<p>Speech and language delays are the biggest contributor to poor school readiness in Reading and joint training is recommended to identify commonalities between the ASQ-3 and EYFS communication criteria.</p>\n<p>Promotion of on line checking of child development is essential. Parents concerned about their child&#8217;s communication can go to the local Berkshire Healthcare Foundation Trust integrated therapies website and self assess their child&#8217;s progress using the early years toolkit. This can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.berkshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/page_sa.asp?fldKey=305\">http://www.berkshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/page_sa.asp?fldKey=305</a>.</p>\n<p>A focus on avoiding child maltreatment (whether by neglect, physical or emotional abuse) and wider safeguarding is essential. Referrals to the early help team are supported by programmes that aim to reduce the risk of a child being taken into care. The early help process offers self help programmes to parents coping with the impact of domestic abuse, alcohol or drug misuse or low levels of parental mental health that do not meet the criteria for referral to adult mental health services.</p>\n<p>Brain development is increased through parent/carer and child interaction and the health visiting teams are trained to promote attachment but as yet do not have a commissioned perinatal mental health service that meets national best practice into which they can refer women who are anxious and depressed. About 50% of women who are assessed as in need of emotional support and physical help who are referred to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services ante or postnatally do not attend these services unless supported by the voluntary sector. This is a gap that is echoed across Berkshire. There is a gap too in perinatal mental health training for other early year&#8217;s staff and volunteers who work with families. This requires multi agency action and has been set as an outcome within the voluntary sector strategy.</p>\n<p>Strategies for reducing barriers to uptake of the 2-2.5 year assessment include offering improved drop in and bookable sessions for working parents through commercial settings and evening and weekend access. This is now a quality indicator in the health visiting service contract.</p>\n<p>Regarding the six high impact areas all require better data sharing and specifically there is a gap in new birth notification which is impacting on the ability to track progress in the early years.</p>\n<p>The other key gap is in comprehensive training for early year&#8217;s staff in attachment and the measures used to assess attachment.</p>\n<p>Parents can be assured that the health visiting services have been trained in Motivational interviewing and in the optimum way to assess child development.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/early-years-foundation-stage-attainment/\">Early Years Foundation Stage Attainment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/perinatal-mental-health/\">Perinatal Mental Health</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Department of Health, 2015.

The term refers to people providing unpaid or informal care as distinct from &#8216;care workers&#8217;. Not all carers are adults, however, and &#8216;young carers&#8217; face a range of risks to their wellbeing on account of providing care. The Carers Trust defines a carer as, &#8220;anyone&#8221; who cares, unpaid, for a friend or family member who due to illness, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction cannot cope without their support&#8221;. Caring can take many forms ranging from practical help with shopping or personal care to providing emotional help and keeping an eye on someone.</p>\n<p>In the 2011 census, 6.5 million people identified themselves as carers in the UK, an 11% rise in numbers since the census in 2001. While the majority of unpaid carers are adults, in 2011 there were over 177, 000 young carers (children under the age of 18 years) providing regular and ongoing care to a family member who is physically or mentally ill, disabled or misuses substances.</p>\n<p>Caring can affect anyone and it is estimated that 3 in 5 people will be carers at some point in their lives (Carers UK). As life expectancy increases and more people are surviving and therefore living with chronic health conditions, it is to be expected that even more of the population will take on a caring role. By 2037, it is predicted that there will be 9 million carers in the UK (Carers UK, 2015). Although the level of caring can vary, more and more carers are providing high levels of care demonstrated by a 25% increase in the number of carers providing more than 50 hours of care a week between 2001 and 2011 (Office for National Statistics, 2011).</p>\n<p>Although rewarding, caring can also have a detrimental effect on a carer&#8217;s health and wellbeing; Responding to the State of Caring Survey (2015), 82% of carers reported caring to have a negative impact on their health. Carers tend to neglect their own health, putting the needs of the person they care for first, often missing routine health check appointments or vaccinations. Caring can particularly impact on mental health as carers report feeling stressed, anxious and suffering from depression. Carers may also experience social isolation and loneliness as their caring role impacts on their ability to maintain social relationships both through lack of free time but also from limited finances. The financial impact of caring can also be substantial with 45% of carers stating that financial worries are affecting their health. Caring can impact on a carer&#8217;s ability to work, with 51% of responding carers having given up work to care and a further 21% reducing their hours (State of Caring 2015); this reduction in income in conjunction with rising costs of caring means that carers are often struggling with financial hardship.</p>\n<p>Similarly to adults, young carers are more likely to describe their health as &#8220;not good&#8221; when compared to young people not providing care; this was particularly likely for young carers providing more than 50 hours a week who were 5 times likely to have &#8220;not good&#8221; health compared to those not providing care (Office for National Statistics).</p>\n<p>Providing a caring role can impact on a young carer&#8217;s emotional development and their ability to build relationships with others, with young carers being at a higher risk of experiencing depression and self-harm. Young carers may come to light through issues at school such as poor attendance, lateness and bullying. However, these, along with anxiety, fatigue and limited access to extracurricular activities can all manifest themselves in lower educational attainment. The Family Action Report in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.family-action.org.uk/content/uploads/2014/06/Be-Bothered-Make-Education-Count-for-Young-Carers.pdf\">&#8220;Be Bothered! Making education count for young carers&#8221;</a> highlighted gaps in awareness and recognition of the extra needs of young carers at school with only 44% of responding teachers stating their school did an adequate or good job supporting young carers. In addition, 49% of young carers stated that their school work had been affected by being a young carer.</p>\n<p>In view of the contribution that carers and young carers make to wider society, the impact of caring on a carer&#8217;s health and wellbeing, and the new rights which carers now have since the introduction of the Care Act (2014) and the Children and Families Act (2014), it is important to understand fully the make-up of our local carer population. The objectives of this Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) are therefore as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To highlight the demography of carers in Reading</li>\n<li>To understand how local provision of services aligns with current national</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strategies and local need</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To identify improvements to be made in order to improve the health and wellbeing of carers in Reading.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>12,315 Reading residents identified themselves as a carer in the 2011 Census, which was 7.9% of the local authority&#8217;s resident population. This is an increase on the 2001 census figures of 7.7% and shows that unpaid care has increased at a faster pace than population growth in Reading over the last decade. This reflects the national picture. Most commentators regard the census statistics as being a reliable indicator of the prevalence of caring amongst adults given that the questions posed do not rely on a person providing care identifying with the term &#8216;carer&#8217; and the fact that a census return must be completed by one adult from every household.</p>\n<p>The actual number of young carers is, however, likely to be higher than indicated by Census results, as shown by a BBC survey in 2010 finding 1 in 12 secondary school pupils across the UK had &#8220;moderate or high levels of care responsibilities&#8221;. Young carers do not have direct access to Census returns as some adult carers may have, and young carers may be reluctant to identify themselves to services due to concerns about being taken into care or bullying. Most young carers are aged between 10 and 17 years of age (Office for National Statistics, 2011) with most providing between 1-19 hours of care a week. In 2011, 8.8% of young carers were providing high levels of care at 50 or more hours a week.</p>\n<p>According to an NHS Information Centre survey, nearly half of carers (40%) care for their parents or parents-in-law, with over a quarter (26%) caring for their spouse or partner. People providing care for disabled children under 18 account for 8% of carers and 5% of carers are looking after adult children. A further 4% care for their grandparents and 7% care for another relative. Whilst the majority care for relatives, one in ten carers (9%) cares for a friend or neighbour.</p>\n<p>Figures collated nationally indicate that the most common need which leads to someone providing unpaid care is physical disability at 58%, followed by sensory impairment and mental health problems at 20% and 13% respectively, with a further 10% providing care for someone with dementia (Carers UK, 2015). This breakdown is broadly consistent with local analysis based on a quite small sample of carers, i.e. 341 carers in who received a service in 2014/15. The majority of those (64.5%) were providing support for someone with a physical disability, 18% were supporting someone with a sensory/visual/memory impairment/learning disability and a further 14.1% were supporting someone with a mental health problem (figure 15). Applying this breakdown to Census estimates of the Reading carer population (12,315 in 2011) gives an estimated local carer population as shown in table 1 below:</p>\n<p>Table1: Estimated breakdown of Reading carer population by primary need of cared for (based on 2011 census data)</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table class=\"bluegeneral\" summary=\"Estimated breakdown of Reading carer population by primary need of cared for (based on 2011 census data)\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluetopleft\">Supporting someone with a physical disability</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">64.5% of 12,315</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopright\">7,943</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Supporting someone with a Sensory/Visual/Memory impairment/Learning Disability</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">18% of 12,315</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">2,217</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Supporting someone with a Mental Health problem</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">14.1% of 12,315</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">1,736</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Supporting someone with Other Needs</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">3.4% of 12,315</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">419</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Census 2011 and LA adult social care statutory returns</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>In 2011, most unpaid carers in Reading were providing 1-19 hours of care a week (66%) &#8211; figure 1). However, 2,599 carers were providing a high level of care at 50 or more hours of unpaid care per week. This is 21% of all carers in Reading and is an increase on 2001&#8217;s figure of 18.1%. 56.5% of unpaid carers in Reading were female in 2011. This percentage increases to 61.3% for unpaid carers who provided 50 or more hours of care per week.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4974/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>In 2011, the proportion of unpaid carers in Reading varied by age group of the carer (Figures 2 &amp; 3). The lowest numbers of unpaid carers were within the 0-15 years&#8217; group. Numbers of carers increased steadily with the age of the carer with the peak age for caring being 50-64 years. At this age, 18.1% of the population in Reading provides unpaid care; this is in line with the age distribution of carers nationally.</p>\n<p>In 2011, there were 1,157 young and young adult carers in Reading (aged 0-24 years). Within the working age population (aged 16-64 years); there were 9,700 unpaid carers in Reading in 2011. This population of carers may require additional support to enable them achieve their potential at either school or in work. 13% of the population in Reading aged over 65 was providing unpaid care (figure 3). As the prevalence of health problems and disability is higher among this age group, providing a caring role may have an additional detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of this group of individuals.</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Number of unpaid carers in Reading by age group (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4984/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011), reproduced from OS data by permission of Ordinance Survey on behalf of the Controller of Her Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office</p>\n<p>Figure 3: Percentage of Reading residents who provided unpaid care by age group (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4985/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011), reproduced from OS data by permission of Ordinance Survey on behalf of the Controller of Her Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office</p>\n<p>The amount of care provided by people from different ethnic groups does vary in Reading. Figure 4 provides this information at a broad ethnic group level and shows that 8.5% of people from a white ethnic group provide unpaid care compared to 4.8% from mixed or multiple ethnic groups. Within each ethnic group, most carers were providing between 1-19 hours of care per week.</p>\n<p>Figure 4: Percentage of Reading residents who provided unpaid care by ethnicity (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4986/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011), reproduced from OS data by permission of Ordinance Survey on behalf of the Controller of Her Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office</p>\n<p>9.2% of people from a Bangladeshi ethnic group provide unpaid care, which is the largest proportion in Reading for any single ethnic group.</p>\n<p>The percentage of the population who are carers also varies between wards in Reading, from 4.4% in Abbey to 12.4% in Mapledurham. Figure 5 shows a map of Reading and highlights where the percentage of residents providing unpaid care is greater. The highest proportions of carers were living in Tilehurst, Southcote, Mapledurham and Peppard wards. Each of these wards have an older age profile in the population with peak numbers in the over 40-45 age group. In addition, these wards have higher than the Reading average of numbers of people with limiting long term illnesses which would correspond to the numbers of carers.</p>\n<p>Figure 6 shows the percentage of Reading residents in each ward who described themselves as having a long term condition. In comparing Figures 5 and 6, it can be seen that two wards (Whitley and Norcot) have higher than average numbers of people with long term illness, but lower than average numbers of carers. This may indicate a level of hidden carers in those areas who have not yet recognised themselves as carers.</p>\n<p>Figure 5: Percentage of Reading residents who provided unpaid care by ward (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5230/Figure-5/image/figure_5.png\" alt=\"Figure 5 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 5</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011), reproduced from OS data by permission of Ordinance Survey on behalf of the Controller of Her Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office</p>\n<p>Figure 6: percentage of Reading residents in each ward who described themselves as having a long term condition</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image6\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4988/image6/image/image6.png\" alt=\"image6 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011), reproduced from OS data by permission of Ordinance Survey on behalf of the Controller of Her Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office</p>\n<h2>Young Carers in Reading</h2>\n<p>In 2011, there were 291 unpaid carers in Reading aged 0 to15 and a further 866 aged 16 to 24. This equates to 1.0% and 3.8% of the population respectively. 57.6% of young carers in Reading were female, which is comparable with the overall figure of 56.5% for all carer age groups. The amount of care provided by Reading&#8217;s young carers is highlighted in Figure 7.</p>\n<p>In 2011, 30 young carers aged 15 or under provided 50 hours or more of care a week. 107 carers aged 16 to 24 also provided this level of care. In both age groups, there were a higher number of carers providing 50 or more hours a week, compared to those providing 20-49 hours a week. The 2011 census provides ward-level data for the number of young carers in Reading. These range from 1.4% of the under 25 population in Thames ward to 2.7% in Church ward. The difference between wards is highlighted in Figure 8. The distribution of young carers across Reading is different from the distribution of adult carers, which may reflect the different age profiles of each ward. Mental health conditions are the most common conditions cared for with 33.4% of identified young carers in Reading providing care for someone with a mental health problem (Figure 9).</p>\n<p>Figure 7: Percentage of Reading residents who provided unpaid care by age group (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image7\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4989/image7/image/image7.png\" alt=\"image7 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011)</p>\n<p>Figure 8: Percentage of Reading residents aged under- 25 who provided unpaid care by ward (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 8\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5229/Figure-8/image/figure_8.png\" alt=\"Figure 8 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 8</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011), reproduced from OS data by permission of Ordinance Survey on behalf of the Controller of Her Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office</p>\n<p>Figure 9: Conditions which young carers known to the Young Carers Project in Reading are providing unpaid care for</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 9\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5228/Figure-9/image/figure_9.png\" alt=\"Figure 9 \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Figure 9</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Young Carers Project Reading</p>\n<h2>Health of Carers in Reading</h2>\n<p>Figure 10: People&#8217;s self-reported statement about their level of health in Reading (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image9\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4991/image9/image/image9.png\" alt=\"image9 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011)</p>\n<p>Unpaid carers in Reading are more likely to suffer from poorer health with only 75.1% describing their health as &#8220;good or very good&#8221;, compared to 86.5% of people who do not provide unpaid care (Figure 10). The likelihood of reporting poorer health rose with the number of hours of care provided as carers providing 50 or more hours of unpaid care a week were three times as likely to describe their health as &#8220;bad or very bad&#8221; compared to people who did not provide unpaid care.</p>\n<p>This finding was consistent across each age group (Figure 11). The health gap was largest for those aged 0-24 years where young carers were over five times as likely to describe their health as &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8221;very bad&#8221; compared to people who do not provide care. The smallest difference in poor health was for those aged 65+ years, likely due to a higher prevalence of health problems in this population as a whole.</p>\n<p>Figure 11: Percentage of people who stated that they had bad or very bad health in Reading (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image10\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4975/image10/image/image10.png\" alt=\"image10 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2011)</p>\n<p>The National GP Patient Survey asks people to state whether they look after or provide help and support to family or friends. In the 2014 Survey, 15.3% of those patients registered to Reading GPs who responded to the survey stated that they looked after or provided this type of support. While this is an increase on the census figures of 7.9% of the population providing unpaid care, it is of note that the response rate to the GP survey was only 33% and it is possible that carers would be more likely to complete the survey than people who do not provide care.</p>\n<p>The NHS Health Check Programme aims to prevent cardiovascular disease, as well as diabetes and kidney disease. People aged 40 to 74, who have no pre-existing condition, are invited to a health check every 5 years to have their circulatory and vascular health assessed. Individuals then receive advice and support to maintain or improve their health, such as making lifestyle changes or being referred on for further tests. GPs in Reading provided an NHS Health Check to 39 identified carers in 2014/15.Whilst this is significantly lower than the numbers of carers in this age group, this health check data is likely to be an under-estimate due to data capture issues. Nevertheless, it highlights an area where accurate up to date information is difficult to obtain for the Reading population.</p>\n<p>Figure 12: Economic status of people aged 16 and over in Reading 2011</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image11\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4976/image11/image/image11.png\" alt=\"image11 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2015)</p>\n<p>Figure 13: Employment status of people aged 16 and over who are economically active in Reading (2011)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image12\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4977/image12/image/image12.png\" alt=\"image12 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2015)</p>\n<p>Carer&#8217;s Allowance (CA) is a non-contributory benefit for people who look after a severely disabled person for at least 35 hours a week, who are not gainfully employed, and who are aged 16 or over and not in full-time education. In August 2014, 1,330 people in Reading received a Carer&#8217;s Allowance. 79% of the recipients were female and 44% were aged between 35 and 49 (Figure 14).

Social Services responsibilities are required to run a national Carers Survey every two years. This survey, which started in 2012/13, has been developed to learn more about whether services received by carers are helping them in their caring role and their life outside of caring. The results of the survey feed into the monitoring of the National Carers Strategy and are also used to populate several measures in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework.</p>\n<p>The latest available results for the national Carers Survey are from 2014/15.</p>\n<p>The Survey asks carers to score their quality of life in a number of different areas, such as how they spend their time, their safety, social participation, personal care, encouragement and support. These scores are then combined to create an overall quality of life score for each carer. In Reading, the average score for carer related quality of life index for 2014/15 was 7.9 out of a maximum score of 12. This is significantly lower than the previous year&#8217;s score of 8.5 but similar to the England&#8217;s average (Figure 17).</p>\n<p>Figure 17: Carer reported quality of life in 2014/15 (Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework measure 1D)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image15\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4980/image15/image/image15.png\" alt=\"image15 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre (2015)</p>\n<p>Quality of life scores differed slightly between different genders and age groups, but these were not significant (Figure 18). In 2014/15, 75% of carers expressed some kind of satisfaction with support received (Figure 19). Of those; 42% were &#8216;Extremely&#8217; or &#8216;Very&#8217; satisfied, with Females and those aged 18-64 in Reading being more satisfied as compared to in England. Males and those aged 65 and over were comparatively less satisfied than those groups in England (Figure 20).</p>\n<p>Figure 18: Carer reported quality of life in 2014/15 by Gender and Age in Reading and England (Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework measure 1D)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image16\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4981/image16/image/image16.png\" alt=\"image16 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre (2015)</p>\n<p>Figure 19: Reading Carers&#8217; satisfaction with support or services they had received from Social Services in the last 12 months in 2014/15.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image17\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4982/image17/image/image17.png\" alt=\"image17 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre (2015)</p>\n<p>Figure 20: Percentage of Carer Survey respondents who were extremely or very satisfied with the support or services they had received from Social Services in the last 12 months in 2014/15 (Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework measure 3B)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image18\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4983/image18/image/image18.png\" alt=\"image18 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre (2015)</p>\n<h2>Current Activities and services</h2>\n<p>From April 2016, the &#8216;Reading and West Berkshire Carers Hub&#8217; will provide carers with a targeted information and advice service, as well as services which support carers to manage caring and to enjoy a life outside caring. These services have been jointly commissioned by Reading Borough Council, West Berkshire Council and the local NHS and are available to all adult carers who are Reading residents or caring for a Reading resident.</p>\n<p>Adult carers in Reading can also access support to take a break through alternative or respite care provided at home or in community settings by Reading Crossroads. Young carers are able to take a break by attending the Council&#8217;s young carers clubs. These clubs give young people time away from caring as well as the opportunity to connect with other young carers and support services to help them manage the issues which young caring raises.</p>\n<p>In addition, carers in Reading can also access support through a number of community services which focus on specific care needs or particular long term health conditions, and take a &#8216;whole family&#8217; approach. These include: Age UK, the Alzheimer&#8217;s society, Mencap, the MS Society, the Parkinson&#8217;s Society, the Stroke Association and the Younger People With Dementia Charity. Support can include advice, training, peer support and opportunities to take part in leisure activities and volunteering.</p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council provides Carers Assessments in line with the Care Act and the Children and Families Act. Carers are also encouraged to be part of any Needs Assessment for the person they support. This gives carers the opportunity to talk about their needs as a carer and what would help them with their caring responsibilities; there is no charge for an assessment. The sorts of help that carers may receive following an assessment include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practical support to help look after the person they care for</li>\n<li>Replacement (respite) care, breaks and Direct Payments to help relieve the stress of caring</li>\n<li>Adaptations, alarms and equipment</li>\n<li>Advice and support on managing stress and looking after your health</li>\n<li>Emergency back-up planning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Young Carers project screening tool has been developed which allows for assessment of the young carer in line with the Children and Families Act 2014 and takes a whole family approach to the needs of the young carer.</p>\n<p>Within the school nursing team in Reading, a School Nurse Champion for Young Carers has been identified and attended training as provided by the Carers Trust. The champion is working closely with schools and the young carer&#8217;s service in order to raise the profile of young carers and disseminating information and training about young carers to the rest of the school nursing team.</p>\n<h2>National Strategies</h2>\n<p>Carers are a government priority with the publication of, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213804/dh_122393.pdf\">&#8220;Recognised, valued and supported: next step for the Carers strategy&#8221;</a> by the coalition government in 2010, subsequently updated as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/368478/Carers_Strategy_-_Second_National_Action_Plan_2014_-_2016.pdf\">Carers Strategy: Second Action Plan 2014-2016</a>.  This describes four priority areas for government:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identification and recognition of carers: helping carers to identify themselves, recognising and valuing their contribution.</li>\n<li>Realising and releasing potential: providing support for carers and young carers to achieve at school and in work. This includes the promotion of health and wellbeing of unpaid carers by employers as part of the <a href=\"https://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/pledges/pledge/?pl=11\">Public Health responsibility deal</a></li>\n<li>A life alongside caring: providing support to enable carers and young carers to have a family and community life. This will be through the provision of information, specific support services highlighted as needed through a Carers Assessment and financial support to enable carers to have breaks.</li>\n<li>Supporting Carers to stay healthy: moving the focus towards early intervention and provision of services, rather than waiting for a crisis to develop. Helping carers to be attentive to their own health including their mental health</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/386221/NHS_England_Mandate.pdf\">Department of Health&#8217;s mandate</a> to NHS England requires that the NHS &#8220;becomes dramatically better at involving patients and their carers, and empowering them to manage and make decisions about their own care and treatment&#8221;. In view of this, in 2014, NHS England set out their <a href=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/commitment-to-carers-may14.pdf\">Commitment to Carers</a> recognising the value of carers to the NHS as well as to the people they care for. This describes a number of priorities, including raising the profile of carers, education and training, primary care, commissioning support, partnership links and NHS England as an employer. In addition, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/256457/At_a_glance_NHS_OF.pdf\">NHS Outcomes Framework (2014/15)</a> includes an indicator to measure the health related quality of life for carers.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/clinical-resources/carers-support.aspx\">Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP)</a> has developed an extensive set of resources to assist GPs in the identification and support of carers within their practices, including an interactive guide on <a href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/clinical-resources/~/media/6C9C69A8CF64490594E464F6E611CC42.ashx\">Commissioning for Carers</a>. In addition, the Caring for Carers Hub is a web based tool, partly funded by the Department of Health and intended to provide information about supporting carers health and wellbeing, along with local information about services, support groups and resources to enable primary care staff to fully support their local carers.</p>\n<p>The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the Association of Directors of Children&#8217;s Services have worked together with The Children&#8217;s Society to develop a model local Memorandum of Understanding in order to promote working together between Adult&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s social services and so provide an enhanced service for young carers and their families as a whole. This provides a resource that can be adapted for use in local areas.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/299270/Young_Carers_pathway_Interactive_FINAL.pdf\">Young Carers Pathway</a> was launched in 2014 as a model approach for school nursing, education, local authorities and young carers&#8217; service to work together. The pathway aims to provide a visible, accessible and confidential service for young carers, promoting partnership working and thereby promoting positive physical and emotional wellbeing for young carers. As school nursing teams are in a unique position to be able to offer support to young carers, the Department of health has been training School Nurse Champions for Young Carers.</p>\n<p>The Carers Trust and The Children&#8217;s Society Young Carers in Focus partners have jointly developed the <a href=\"https://professionals.carers.org/stepbystep\">Young Carers in Schools</a> initiative across England, aiming to equip schools to support young carers and then awarding good practice. The step by step guide helps schools to identify and support young carers and the expert regional networks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.carersweek.org/\">Carers Week</a> is a national campaign which happens in June every year to raise the awareness of caring and the challenges faced by carers on a daily basis. In 2015, Carers Week focused on building Carer Friendly Communities and a number of organisations came together to organise activities and events across the UK, including Carers UK and the Carers Trust among others. It provides an opportunity for all partners involved in supporting carers to identify new carers through raising awareness and also to signpost carers to services that are available for support. Similarly, Carers Rights Day in November is a more focused annual event with the same aims.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Caring impacts on the health and wellbeing of the carer and this is also demonstrated for carers in Reading, with carers being more likely to report poor health and less likely to report good health compared to those who do not provide unpaid care. Just over half of carers in Reading have as much social contact as they would like, which is higher than the national average but shows there are still many carers who would like a higher level of social contact.</p>\n<p>Carers in Reading are more likely to be included in discussions about the person they care for, than carers nationally. However, they find it less easy than carers nationally to find information about services. This is according to a survey of a proportion of the local carer population.</p>\n<p>The majority of carers in Reading are of working age and therefore may require support both to stay in work if desired and to achieve their full potential. In addition, financial support may also be required in order to manage their caring responsibilities alongside working.</p>\n<p>The young and young adult carers are distributed differently across Reading than older carers; this may have consequences for service provision. While most young carers are providing between 1-19 hours of unpaid care a week, over 10% are providing a high level of care (50+ hours a week).</p>\n<p>Young carers in Reading show a marked increase in poor health when compared to young people who are not providing unpaid care.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of national schemes and priorities now in place; however, these are yet to fully translate to the local population of Reading. There are still large numbers of hidden carers in Reading &#8211; some who may have not yet self-identified and a further proportion not known to local services. It is not yet clear how many GP practices operate a carer&#8217;s register in Reading; this may give a clearer picture of the local carer population and present opportunities for effective commissioning of carers-specific services.</p>\n<p>Young carers are already isolated mainly because they do not wish to discuss their situation or do not know where to turn for support. The number of young carers known to the local authority is much lower than the estimated number of young carers in Reading, but other agencies, e.g. schools, may be better placed to identify and support young carers.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>In Reading, the highest proportion of unpaid carers are within the 50-64 age group with women being more likely to provide higher levels (50+ hours a week) of unpaid care compared to men.</p>\n<p>The numbers of carers varies by ethnic group with the highest proportion (9.2%) amongst the Reading Bangladeshi population and lowest proportion (4.8%) in the mixed/multiple ethnic group.</p>\n<p>Unpaid carers are less likely to have good health and more likely to have poor health when compared to people who do not provide unpaid care. The health gap is particularly marked for those individuals providing more than 50 hours of unpaid care a week.</p>\n<p>Compared to people who do not provide unpaid care, carers are less likely to be economically active and more likely to be in part time work.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/general-wellbeing/\">General Wellbeing</a></p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>The compilation of the Carers JSNA has been guided by the Reading Borough Council Carers Needs Assessment.</p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Carers UK <a href=\"http://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/press-releases/facts-and-figures\">http://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/press-releases/facts-and-figures</a> accessed 8/02/16</li>\n<li>Carers UK, 2015 Policy Briefing | August 2015 | Facts about carers <a href=\"https://www.carersuk.org/for-professionals/policy/policy-library/facts-about-carers-2015\">https://www.carersuk.org/for-professionals/policy/policy-library/facts-about-carers-2015</a> accessed 17/02/16</li>\n<li>Carers Trust <a href=\"https://www.carers.org/what-carer\">https://www.carers.org/what-carer</a> accessed 16/02/16</li>\n<li>Census 2011 and Census 2001, Office for National Statistics</li>\n<li>Working Together to Support Young Carers and their Families <a href=\"http://www.youngcarer.com/sites/default/files/imce_user_files/PTP/mou_young_carers_2012.pdf\">http://www.youngcarer.com/sites/default/files/imce_user_files/PTP/mou_young_carers_2012.pdf</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This can cause angina (chest pain) or heart attack.</li>\n<li>Stroke &#8211; when blood supply to a person&#8217;s brain is restricted or cut off and brain cells begin to die, sometimes causing brain damage or death.</li>\n<li>Peripheral arterial disease &#8211; a blockage in the arteries to a person&#8217;s limbs &#8211; usually their legs &#8211; resulting in pain when exercising (e.g. walking up stairs)</li>\n<li>Aortic disease &#8211; most commonly aortic aneurysm &#8211; when the aorta (the largest blood vessel in the body) becomes weakened and bulges outward, resulting in pain in chest and abdomen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Risk factors include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>\n<li>Smoking</li>\n<li>High blood cholesterol</li>\n<li>Diabetes</li>\n<li>Low levels of physical exercise</li>\n<li>Being overweight or obese</li>\n<li>Family history of heart disease</li>\n<li>Ethnic background (CVD is most common in South Asian people)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important risk is high blood pressure, which is itself linked to lack of exercise, being overweight, smoking and drinking alcohol and is a key cause of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attack (<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Cardiovascular-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">NHS Choices, 2016</a>).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Recorded and Estimated Prevalence of Hypertension in Reading (Local Authority area) and by CCG (2014/15)</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table class=\"bluegeneral\" summary=\"Recorded and Estimated Prevalence of Hypertension in Reading (Local Authority area) and by CCG (2014/15)\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluetopleft\"></td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">Recorded</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopcenter\">Estimated</td>\n<td class=\"bluetopright\">% Hypertension detected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">South Reading CCG</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">10.2%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">19.1%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">54.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">North and West Reading CCG</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">13.2%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">23.6%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">56.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Reading Local Authority</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">11.2%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">20.3%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">56.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">England</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">13.7%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">24.7%</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">54.3%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Healthier Lives <a href=\"http://healthierlives.phe.org.uk/topic/hypertension/comparisons\">http://healthierlives.phe.org.uk/topic/hypertension/comparisons</a></p>\n<p>The actual prevalence of high blood pressure is estimated to be considerably higher than detected through contact with GPs (Table 1), with almost half of cases thought to be undetected. The rate of undetected high blood pressure is estimated to be higher in Reading than the England average.</p>\n<p>Whilst the rate of mortality from CVD is higher than in similar areas, the good news is that the rate is declining &#8211; the annual number of deaths has fallen by half since 1961 &#8211; but is still significant.

This suggests that those from BME ethnic groups may be more likely to develop CVD at body weight not considered risky.</p>\n<h2>National and local strategies (current best practice)</h2>\n<p>NICE guidance on preventing CVD (NICE, 2010) recommends interventions at population and individual level. The guidance makes the case for CVD as a major public health problem and makes the following recommendations based on &#8220;extensive and consistent evidence&#8221;:</p>\n<h2>Policy Recommendations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce the amount of salt, saturated fat and trans fats in people&#8217;s diets;</li>\n<li>Restrict marketing and promotions aimed at children that undermine a child&#8217;s right to a healthy diet</li>\n<li>Reduce lobbying by food and drink industries</li>\n<li>Ensure clear product labelling</li>\n<li>Carry out health impact assessments on new policies, especially considering impact on CVD</li>\n<li>Common Agricultural Policy to take account of CVD issues</li>\n<li>Ensure local transport plans support physically active travel</li>\n<li>Ensure public sector catering meet Food Standard Agency&#8217;s approved dietary guidelines.</li>\n<li>Restrict planning permission for takeaways and other food retail in specific areas (for example, near schools)</li>\n<li>Monitor and scrutinise CVD data, including prevention activity</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practice Recommendations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure CVD prevention programmes: comprise intense, multi-component interventions; are targeted at the whole population and complement interventions aimed at individuals who are at higher risk; and are sustainable for at least 5 years, adequately resourced and realistic to implement.</li>\n<li>Ensure prevention programmes are based on an understanding of the local community and their needs, are based on theories about what will work for the population, and are monitored and evaluated.</li>\n<li>Ensure those working with children and young people help them to have a healthy diet and lifestyle and ensure that food provided by the public sector is low in salt and saturated fat and is nutritionally balanced and varied.</li>\n<li>Promote physical activity through the physical environment, transport system and local provision (e.g. provide cycle routes and safe pedestrian routes, do not prohibit ball games in public spaces, consider offering free swimming to parents and carers who accompany children under 5 to pools)</li>\n<li>Use a variety of methods to assess the potential impact of all local and regional policies and plans on CVD and related chronic diseases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>CVD has a significant impact on health and mortality across England and is a particularly important cause of premature death in Reading. Many of the risk factors for CVD are based on lifestyle and support to enable residents to maintain a healthy weight, take part in physical exercise and stop smoking are likely to have an impact on high rates of mortality. In addition, more work is needed locally to ensure that local decision-making takes account of the impact of decisions on CVD incidence and mortality locally.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>CVD is more prevalent amongst those in more deprived socioeconomic groups and appears to disproportionately affect those from South Asian and some other Black and minority ethnic groups. These inequalities should be taken into account when assessing local decisions and policies and when planning interventions to support healthy lifestyles.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>The high rate of premature death from CVD in Reading compared to similar areas suggests that more can be done locally to support residents to reduce risks for CVD related to lifestyle.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/jsna/deprivation-by-ward\">Deprivation by Ward and Lower Super Output Area</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/ethnicity/\">Ethnicity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/physical-activity/\">Physical Activity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity &#8211; adult &amp; child</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>BHF.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Cancer is the most common cause of premature death in Reading and disproportionately affects socio-economically deprived populations. A considerable proportion of cancer cases are related to lifestyle, especially smoking. Rates of cancer incidence and mortality from cancer are similar to the England and South-East averages, but incidence rates are considerable and increasing nationally.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>A cancer is an abnormal growth in otherwise normal tissue. Cells that in usual circumstances divide to replace old or damaged cells, divide in an uncontrolled way. Both primary and secondary cancer growths (those in the place in the body where a cancer starts and those in places in the body into which that cancer then spreads) impede and inhibit body functions, often leading to serious weakness and death (Cancer Research, 2016a; <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cancer/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">NHS Choices, 2016</a>).</p>\n<p>296,863 cancers were registered in the UK in 2014, equivalent to 813 registrations a day, with breast (15.6%), prostate (13.4%), lung (12.6%) and colorectal (11.5%) cancers accounting for more than half of all registrations. There were slightly more registrations amongst men than women (ONS, 2016). Incidence of cancers increases with age (figure 1), with rates per 100,000 population increasing steadily from the 55-59 age group until the group aged 85-89.</p>\n<p>An estimated 42% of cancer cases are linked to lifestyle and environmental factors (Cancer Research, 2016c), including some 64,500 cases a year (19% of all cancer cases) linked to smoking.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: Average number of new cases per year and incidence rates per 100,000 (all cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancer)</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4965/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/incidence/age\">Cancer Research UK</a></p>\n<p>Incidence of all cancers is higher amongst the most deprived socio-economic groups than the least deprived; the European age-standardised incidence rate in England for 2006-2010 was 432.1 for the most deprived, compared to 366.3 for the least deprived (Cancer Research, 2016b). The difference in incidence between the most and least deprived is more pronounced for certain types of cancer. Cancers of the larynx and lung &#8211; strongly linked with smoking and alcohol use (see Chan et al, 2015) &#8211; show the largest percentage deprivation gaps (Figure 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2: Percentage Deprivation Gap in European Age-Standardised Incidence Rates, statistically significant cancers, males (left) and females (right) 2006-2010</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4966/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image3\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4967/image3/image/image3.png\" alt=\"image3 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/incidence/socio-economic-group\">Cancer Research UK</a> (Acronyms: CUP= Cancer of Unknown Primary, AML = Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, ALL =Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, NHL = Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma)</p>\n<p>Cancer incidence rates in South Reading CCG (597.1 per 100,000) and North &amp; West Reading CCG (571.6 per 100,000) are similar to or lower than the England average of (606.7 per 100,000) (NCIN Cancer Data, 2015).</p>\n<p>Cancers are the most common cause of premature death in Reading (PHE, 2015), responsible for 142 deaths in every 100,000 people aged under 75 in Reading. The under 75 mortality rate from cancer reported in the Public Health Outcome Framework (PHOF) is similar to the England average and the rate of premature deaths from cancers in Reading is ranked 72nd out of 150 local authorities and can therefore be considered similar to the national picture.</p>\n<p>The incidence rate in Reading has varied over the last twenty years, but is not significantly different to the national or regional averages and is increasing in Reading, as elsewhere. Locally, prevalence of cancer cases is lower than elsewhere in Berkshire (Figures 3 and 4), which is likely to be linked to the younger age profile of Reading&#8217;s population compared to its neighbours. However, one year cancer survival in Reading appears to be slightly lower than the England average (Cancer Research, 2016c) suggesting that diagnosis may occur later than elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 3: Cancer incidence per 100,000 standardised population &#8211; all cancers</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4968/image4/image/image4.png\" alt=\"image4 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: NHS Indicator Portal</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 4: Cancer prevalence &#8211; Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) for April 2014 &#8211; March 2015, England</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4969/image5/image/image5.png\" alt=\"image5 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Health and Social Information Centre</p>\n<p>As elsewhere, rates of premature mortality from cancer tend to be more pronounced amongst the more deprived populations within Reading. Rates are highest in three of the wards that include very high areas of deprivation (see Figure 5); Abbey (around the town centre, this area is particularly affected by poor living environment and high crime); Norcot (the Dee Road area is particularly affected by deprivation related to income and employment); and Whitley (the most deprived ward in Reading, particularly affected by income, employment, and education deprivation). Patterns of deprivation in Reading are complex (See Deprivation by Ward and LSOA section), but there is a clear relationship in rates of premature mortality from cancer between the most and least deprived in Reading (see Figure 6). Screening for breast, bowel and cervical cancers is lower than average in Reading, suggesting that more could be done to prevent harm from cancer, especially in areas with high deprivation, or where smoking and alcohol use are known to be higher (PHE, 2016, Cancer Research, 2016d).</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 5: Premature Mortality Rate (aged under 75) From All Cancers</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image6\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4970/image6/image/image6.png\" alt=\"image6 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Primary Care Mortality Database</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 6: Premature Mortality Rate per 100,000 from All Cancers &#8211; Reading deprivation quintiles (based on 2015 ward deprivation- 5 is most deprived)</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image7\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4971/image7/image/image7.png\" alt=\"image7 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Primary Care Mortality Database</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>While the chances of being diagnosed with cancer or dying from cancer in Reading are similar to elsewhere in England, cancers are still the most common cause of premature deaths in Reading.

    "title": "Breastfeeding rates",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants in the first stages of life. Breastfeeding has a major role to play in promoting public health and reducing inequalities. The case for investing in services to support breastfeeding to reduce health inequalities is well documented, evidence based and compelling: increases in breastfeeding are expected to reduce illness in young children, have health benefits for infants and their mothers and results in cost savings to the NHS through reduced admissions for the treatment of infection in infants (Quigley et al, 2007). Breastfeeding saves lives and protects the health of babies and mothers, and increases children&#8217;s future life chances. There is evidence that babies who are breast fed experience lower levels of gastro-intestinal and respiratory infection. Observational studies have shown that breastfeeding is associated with lower levels of child obesity. Benefits to the mother include a faster return to pre-pregnancy weight and possibly lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer (BMA Board of Science, 2009).</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Breastfeeding statistics are collected at two time points: breastfeeding initiation data is collected within 48 hours of the birth of a baby, data is also collected by health visitors when the baby is 6-8 weeks of age on whether the baby is fully or partially breastfed.</p>\n<p>Breastfeeding initiation falls under the remit of maternity services which is a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) commissioned service. Data on breastfeeding initiation is reported directly from hospital trusts to NHS England to allow reporting at a CCG and trust level.</p>\n<p>Breastfeeding at 6 to 8 weeks falls under the remit of health visiting services and prior to October 2015 this was a NHS England commissioned service with data reported directly from child health information systems to NHS England to allow reporting at a CCG level. These data at initiation and at 6 to 8 weeks could be compared to provide an estimate in the drop-off of breastfeeding rates between these two time points.</p>\n<p>Since April 2003, data on the local breastfeeding prevalence at 6-8 weeks have been requested on a quarterly basis, historically from all Primary Care Trusts (PCT), via the Department of Health (DH), Integrated Performance Monitoring Returns. This provides more timely, frequent and local information on breastfeeding prevalence at 6-8 weeks than the Infant Feeding Survey.</p>\n<p>Changes to NHS and Local Authority commissioning over recent years have affected the collection of breastfeeding statistics and it should be noted that these changes will affect the quality of breastfeeding data until they are fully embedded. From October 2015 health visiting became a Local Authority commissioned service with provision moving from being GP registered based to being Local Authority resident based. Therefore, data is now reported at a Local Authority level. Although the transfer occurred from October 2015, data is been retrospectively reported by Local Authorities to Public Health England from 1st April 2015 to determine the baseline in data at a Local Authority level prior to the transfer.</p>\n<p>Since April 2013 these data are now being collected directly from providers via the data collection tool that is part of Unify2, a web based system set up to collect performance and other central returns directly from the NHS.

Reading&#8217;s breastfeeding initiation rates have generally been increasing over recent years (except for 2012/13) and have been well above the England averages. Breastfeeding initiation in Reading for 2014/15 was 79.0% which is higher than the South East area (78.0%) and also higher than the England average (74.3%).</p>\n<p>Table 1: Breastfeeding initiation &#8211; Percentage of all mothers who breastfed in the first 48 hours after delivery: E&amp;W, SE and Reading &#8211; 2010/11 to 2014/15</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Breastfeeding initiation\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>2010/11</th>\n<th>2011/12</th>\n<th>2012/13</th>\n<th>2013/14</th>\n<th>2014/15</th>\n<th>2015/16</th>\n<th>2016/17</th>\n<th>2017/18</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<td>77.9</td>\n<td>78.0</td>\n<td>77.6</td>\n<td>78.5</td>\n<td>79.0</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>South East</th>\n<td>78.0</td>\n<td>78.1</td>\n<td>77.1</td>\n<td>77.0</td>\n<td>78.0</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>England</th>\n<td>73.7</td>\n<td>74.0</td>\n<td>73.9</td>\n<td>73.9</td>\n<td>74.3</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework, 2015</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Breastfeeding initiation &#8211; Percentage of all mothers who breastfed in the first 48 hours after delivery: E&amp;W, SE and Reading &#8211; 2010/11 to 2014/15</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5083/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework, 2015</p>\n<p>It is very encouraging that breastfeeding initiation rates are higher than regional and national averages. This means that, proportionately, more infants will be getting the health benefits from their mother&#8217;s milk. We need to continue the increasing trend so that even more newborns benefit from breastfeeding initiation.</p>\n<p>The improving breastfeeding initiation rates are positive however increased benefits for the baby and mother are achieved if breastfeeding is sustained for longer periods of time. It is recommended that babies should be breastfed exclusively for 6 months however an alternative key measure is breastfeeding status at 6-8 weeks after birth.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Totally breastfed&#8217; is defined as infants who are exclusively receiving breast milk at 6-8 weeks of age &#8211; that is, they are not receiving formula milk, any other liquids or food. &#8216;Partially breastfed&#8217; is defined as infants who are currently receiving breast milk at 6-8 weeks of age and who are also receiving formula milk or any other liquids or food. &#8216;Not at all breastfed&#8217; is defined as infants who are not currently receiving any breast milk at 6-8 weeks of age.</p>\n<p>There are some problems with national monitoring in that all data cannot be validated due to reporting issues. 114 out of 152 local authorities submitted data for the Q1 2015/16 breastfeeding at 6-8 week data return. 43 local authorities passed all three stages of validation. The breastfeeding rate for England based on 89 local authorities who passed the initial stage of validation was 43.8%. Non- validated data result in null returns which are shown in Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF) reports. These appear as gaps in our local reporting as shown in Table 2 and Figure 2 below.</p>\n<p>For 2012/13 and earlier, the data for this indicator was only available at PCT level. Therefore in some cases local authority values were estimated. For local authorities that were wholly contained within a PCT, the value for the whole PCT was used for that local authority. For those local authorities that were split across PCT boundaries, the local authority value was estimated using weighted PCT data. From 2013/14, this indicator is available directly at local authority level. As a result, between 2012/13 and 2013/14 there might be unexpected increases or decreases in the trajectory of this indicator for particular local authorities.</p>\n<p>Table 2: Breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks &#8211; Percentage of all mothers who are still partially or totally breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks: E&amp;W, SE and Reading &#8211; 2010/11 to 2014/15</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>2010/11</th>\n<th>2011/12</th>\n<th>2012/13</th>\n<th>2013/14</th>\n<th>2014/15</th>\n<th>2015/16</th>\n<th>2016/17</th>\n<th>2017/18</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Reading</th>\n<td>55.4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>55.6</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>South East</th>\n<td>48.4</td>\n<td>50.9</td>\n<td>50.1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>England</th>\n<td>46.1</td>\n<td>47.2</td>\n<td>47.2</td>\n<td>45.8</td>\n<td>43.8</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework, 2015</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks &#8211; Percentage of all mothers who are still partially or totally breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks: E&amp;W, SE and Reading &#8211; 2010/11 to 2014/15</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Breastfeeding rates at 6-8 weeks\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/5085/Breastfeeding-rates-at-6-8-weeks/image/Breastfeeding_at_6-8_weeks.png\" alt=\"Breastfeeding rates at 6-8 weeks \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">Breastfeeding rates at 6-8 weeks</span></span></p>\n<p>Source: Public Health Outcomes Framework, 2015</p>\n<p>We know locally that the rate of breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks is higher than the England average (Figure 3 below). However work needs to be done to ensure that submitted local data can pass the validation tests, and subsequently reported by the national mechanisms and avoiding similar gaps as shown in the table above and chart below.</p>\n<p>The difference in prevalence from breastfeeding initiation to breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks reduces significantly. We want to encourage more new mothers to sustain breastfeeding for longer, ideally for 6 months or more, so that both baby and mother receive the health benefits described above.</p>\n<p>There are distinct differences in rates of sustained breastfeeding and this is monitored locally by Children&#8217;s Centres where new babies are registered at. The tables and chart in Figure 3 on the following page show a &#8216;snapshot&#8217; of numbers and percentages of breastfeeding status at the 6 &#8211; 8 week health visitor check by Readings Children&#8217;s Centres, as of Quarter 4 in 2014/15.</p>\n<p>As can be seen, the rates of babies still been totally or partially breastfed at 6-8 weeks vary dramatically across Reading. The chart shows that Surestart Whitley (36%), Norcot (41%) and Blagrave (48%) have the three lowest rates and that Emmer Green (72%), East Reading (71%) and Hamilton Road (71%) have the three highest rates. As mentioned, the data above is from a single quarter period and numbers do fluctuate slightly over time, however, the trend in lowest and highest rate areas have remained fairly static. There is clearly an inequality in breastfeeding uptake and further efforts are needed to encourage new mothers to breastfeed in the usually lower uptake areas, to hopefully bring them up towards the higher performing areas. This would help to reduce the inequality gap and enable more new babies, and their mothers, to reap the health benefits from initiating and sustaining breastfeeding in line with recommendations.</p>\n<p>Figure 3.

BFI is an evidence-based world-wide programme that works with health care providers to achieve a set of quality standards that will ensure high quality care for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers and babies in supporting the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. The implementation of these breastfeeding quality standards is practiced and delivered by the Health Visiting and midwifery services serving Reading and are co-ordinated and led by an Infant Feeding Co-ordinator.</li>\n<li>NICE Public Health Guidance (2008) on <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph11\">Maternal and Child Nutrition (PH11)</a> recommends encouraging breastfeeding by providing information, practical advice and ongoing support &#8211; including the help of breastfeeding peer supporters and advice on how to store expressed breast milk safely.</li>\n<li>The breastfeeding peer support service volunteers work at the Royal Berkshire Hospital supporting new mothers, if they want it, to breastfeed. Referrals are made to the service for further support if wanted. There is a specific focus in wards where breastfeeding initiation and at 6-8 weeks rates are lowest. A telephone advice/helpline service and volunteer run drop-ins within the local community are also available. The service aims to make contact with women who have started breastfeeding within 72 hours of giving birth, to provide help and tailored 1:1 support at a time when many may otherwise stop breastfeeding. The primary objective of this service is to reduce the level of drop off rates from those who initiate breastfeeding and to encourage sustained breastfeeding for a minimum of 6 &#8211; 8 weeks. This service is provided in line with best practice and evidence based interventions as described by NICE guidance <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph11\">Maternal and Child Nutrition (PH11)</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Locally in Reading, we are doing well in terms of initiating breastfeeding and positive actions are been implemented in terms of increasing prevalence rates. We should strive to at least maintain this trend and hopefully increase the rate of improvement.</p>\n<p>Breastfeeding has a major role to play in promoting public health and reducing health inequalities. There are long-standing stark differences locally in prevalence by ward area (Figure 3 above) identified at the 6-8 week check.</p>\n<p>To increase the number of mother&#8217;s breastfeeding, a sustainable, co-ordinated approach is needed requiring effective partnerships between statutory, voluntary and community services, with a focus in areas of Reading where prevalence is lower.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>There are differences by socio-economic groups. Living in more deprived communities or being disadvantaged can significantly affect individual lifestyle behaviour choices and subsequently the health of individuals and their new born children. Focused attention on service/intervention delivery should be given in those areas where outcomes are not as good as areas that are performing well&#8230;so that inequality gaps start to reduce. The focus on targeted preventative services will help to achieve this.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/service gaps?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Greater opportunities to provide breastfeeding education and promotion along with ante-natal information on the support and services available to support breastfeeding mothers.</li>\n<li>Increased opportunities for Health Visitors to provide early intervention and support to breastfeeding mothers within the first few days of giving birth and/or discharge from hospital to reduce the drop off rate from initiation.</li>\n<li>Increased capacity in the peer support service provided by the Breastfeeding Network so they are able to provide greater access to their 1:1 support services.</li>\n<li>Greater opportunities for breastfeeding mothers to attend breastfeeding drop-ins</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/maternity/\">Maternity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/perinatal-mental-health/\">Perinatal Mental Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/infant-mortality/\">Infant Mortality</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity &#8211; adult &amp; child</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cancer/\">Cancer</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>BMA Board of Science, 2009. <em>Early life nutrition and lifelong health</em>.</p>\n<p>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2006.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Reading continues to have a higher birth rate than national and regional averages, and is therefore likely to have a greater need for maternity and early years services than elsewhere in the short term, and greater demand for infrastructure development and universal services in future. In the ten years preceding the last census, Reading has become increasingly ethnically diverse and some neighbourhoods have become increasingly deprived.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Having an understanding of the predicted future birth rates, and potential changes to the population levels, can support the planning and commissioning of future services for local people.</p>\n<p>The General Fertility Rate (GFR) is the number of live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Rates are based on the most up-to-date population estimates. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is the average number of live children that would be born to each woman in a population based on the fertility rate of women in her age group in that calendar year throughout her childbearing lifespan (London Data Store, 2015).</p>\n<p>The TFR is calculated using the number of live births and mid-year population estimates (sub-nationally) and the population projections (nationally) for women by single year of age. This generally produces a more accurate picture of the number of births to those most likely to give birth. However, population estimates at local authority level are relatively small, meaning that rates generated using single year of age can risk producing spurious results.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>The latest data release from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) was in 2016 and show information for the year 2015. The data show that in England and Wales, the average age of mothers in 2015 was 30.2 years (ONS, 2016). On the whole, general fertility rates in England and Wales have remained similar in recent years. In 2008, the GFR was 62.7 live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in England and Wales. The rate rose to 64.9 in 2012 but has since reduced to 62.5 by 2015.</p>\n<p>Table 1 below shows that there were 66.8 live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44 living in Reading in 2015. This gives Reading a general fertility rate that is much higher than the national average. The GFR for Reading has been consistently higher than the national and regional averages.</p>\n<p>Table 1: General Fertility Rates England &amp; Wales (E&amp;W) and Reading</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 343px;\" summary=\"General Fertility Rates England &amp; Wales (E&amp;W), South East (SE) and Reading\" width=\"587\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluetopleft\"></td>\n<td class=\"bluetopright\" colspan=\"10\">Year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueeven\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\"></td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2008</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2009</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2010</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2011</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2012</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2013</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2014</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2015</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">2016</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\">2017</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">E&amp;W</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">62.7</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">62.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">64.0</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">64.0</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">64.8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">62.2</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">62.1</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">62.5</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\"></td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"blueodd\">\n<td class=\"bluemiddleleft\">Reading</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">71.9</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">67.2</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">69.7</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">67.8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">72.1</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">68.6</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">67.0</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\">66.8</td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddlecenter\"></td>\n<td class=\"bluemiddleright\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source for 2015: Office for National Statistics (2016); Birth by mother&#8217;s usual area of residence in the UK</p>\n<p>The number of babies born to families living in Reading in 2015 was 2,521 (ONS, 2016), a small reduction of 33 from 2,554 in 2014 (ONS, 2015).</p>\n<p>Figure 1.

As mentioned above, these rates are based on very small population numbers and are therefore considered volatile (which may explain the unusual results in 2011). Nonetheless, there is a prevailing trend towards a reduction in the number of children born to each woman that is reflected in both the national and local rates.</p>\n<p>Figure 2.

3 above shows a national picture of births by age groups over the last ten years. Throughout, the majority of births are to mothers aged 25-34. The fertility rate in mothers aged under 20 has reduced from 26.4 in 2005 to 15.6 in 2014 while the fertility rate amongst those aged over 35 has increased. This may reflect more women continuing with work and study for longer before starting a family or births as part of new relationships later in life.</p>\n<p>Figure 4 shows the number and rate of births in each ward in the Reading area in 2015. The highest number of births were to residents of Battle ward (251 births &#8211; around 10% of all births in the borough), and the lowest to residents of Mapledurham ward (24 births &#8211; less than 1% of births). The highest rate of births were to residents of Kentwood ward (89.4 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44), with the lowest to residents of Church ward (43.8 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44). Although these rates are based on small population numbers, monitoring trends in where in the borough fertility rates are highest may help to understand where needs for infrastructure and demand for universal services such as schools and primary health care, are likely to grow the most. It can also help to indicate where the largest number are likely to be born into disadvantage and deprivation, and are therefore most likely to benefit from support.</p>\n<p>Figure 4: Number and rate of births by ward in Reading local authority &#8211; 2015</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"Figure 4\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6829/Figure-4/image/fig_4_number_and_rate.png\" alt=\"Figure 4 \" /><br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Source: Office for National Statistics (2016); Annual births data and Ward level Mid-year population estimates.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Shaping-Readings-Future-Corporate-Plan-2018-21.pdf\">Shaping Reading&#8217;s Future &#8211; Corporate Plan 2018-21</a> cites &#8216;providing the best start in life through education, early help and healthy living&#8217; and &#8216;providing the infrastructure to support the economy&#8217; as key priorities for the locality. Initiatives have included included expanding school places, delivering additional and affordable homes and improving roads and public transport.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Reading continues to have a higher birth rate than national and regional averages, and is therefore likely to have a greater need for maternity and early years services than elsewhere in the short term, and greater demand for infrastructure development and universal services in future.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Reading is currently ranked 146th of the most deprived 326 Local Authorities, with two neighbourhoods in the 10% most deprived areas in the country and over 6,000 children estimated to be living in poverty. Those born into disadvantage are less likely to live healthy lives and more likely to die prematurely.</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs / service gaps?</h2>\n<p>In the immediate and short term, high rates of fertility will continue to lead to high demand for maternity and infant care and healthcare related to fertile years for women. Population change in Reading is partly driven by natural change (the number of births and deaths) and partly by international migration to the area. Patterns of migration into the UK suggest that roughly half of the increase in population is likely to be accountable to females and most are aged between 25 and 44. It may therefore be anticipated that young working age adults moving to Reading for work and study may decide to to start their families in the town. In the ten years preceding the last census Reading has become increasingly ethnically diverse with the proportion of the population identifying themselves as White British falling from 86.8% in 2001 to 66.9% in 2011.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA):</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/infant-mortality/\">Infant Mortality</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity &#8211; adult &amp; child</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/sexual-health/\">Sexual Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/population-change/\">Population Change</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/general-wellbeing/\">General Wellbeing</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>London Data Store (2015), Births and fertility rates.

    "title": "Autism",
    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Autism is a condition that affects people in a variety of different ways and degrees.  In 2015, Reading Borough Council (RBC) published the <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Autism-Strategy-2015-18.pdf\">Autism Strategy for Children, Young People and Adults 2015-18</a><em>, </em>which outlines the commitments the organisation has made to improve the lives of people with autism in Reading.  The Strategy set out how RBC aims to achieve this through commissioning and delivery of services and close working with partners locally. As a part of the development of the Strategy, the Berkshire Autistic Society (BAS) carried out an assessment of needs of the people with autism in Reading and the services available.  The following is an overview of the outcomes of this very important piece of work.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>The term &#8220;autism&#8221; is often used as an umbrella description for all autism conditions, including Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, that fall under the headings of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC).  Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to others, how a person learns and makes sense of the work and processes information.  People who are on the autistic spectrum can sometimes share difficulties in one or more of the following three areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social communication (e.g. understanding verbal and non-verbal language)</li>\n<li>Social interaction (e.g. recognising and understanding other people&#8217;s feelings)</li>\n<li>Social imagination (e.g. restrictive repetitive patterns of behaviour)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a spectrum condition, autism affects people in varying ways and requires differing level of support.  Some people with autism live independent lives, but others need a lifetime of specialist support.  Autistic people may have other co-existing conditions, such as a learning disability, or mental health needs, but autism is neither a learning disability nor a mental health problem (Brugha et al, 2012). We use the terms &#8220;people with autism&#8221; and &#8220;autistic people&#8221; in this chapter.</p>\n<p>Autism is often a &#8220;hidden disability&#8221;, meaning that it is not always possible to tell that someone has the condition, this makes raising awareness of the condition even more important.  People with high-functioning autism may go for many years without a diagnosis, even if they experience less obvious difficulties. Regardless of how a person&#8217;s autism affects their lives and the lives of their family and carers, locally we want to ensure there is appropriate awareness, support, information and advice available to help people live a fulfilling and rewarding life.</p>\n<p>The National Autistic Society estimates that around 1.1% of the UK population may be on the autistic spectrum, or around 700,000 people. This is a broad estimate, however, with the true proportion likely to fall between 0.3% and 1.9%. (National Autistic Society, Accessed 2016; Brugha et al, 2012) and local experts suggest that the proportion of people in Reading with autism may be higher, estimated to approximately 2000 people (roughly three quarters adults and one quarter children and young people).</p>\n<p>The Projection of Adults Needs and Service Information (PANSI) suggests an increase of the number of working age adults (aged 18-64) with autism in Reading over the next twenty years, rising to 1,114 people by 2030 (PANSI). The increase is expected to be driven by children and young people with autism growing older; as well as people moving to Reading for jobs and education. This anticipated increase means that it is important that there are appropriate services and support in place to meet this need.</p>\n<p>While there is no evidence that autism is more prevalent within any particular ethnic groups, growing ethnic diversity in Reading&#8217;s population will mean that services and support will need to continue to be mindful of the need to provide a culturally competent and culturally sensitive service that is accessible and responsive to those that need it. Between 2001 and 2011, the proportion of residents identifying with an ethnicity other than White British increased from 13.2% to 33.1% (RBC, 2012) and applying estimated prevalence to census data suggests there are likely to be some 500 people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups with autism in Reading, of whom around a quarter are likely to be aged 18 or younger.</p>\n<p>Comparing these prevalence estimates with the numbers known to Reading Borough Council services demonstrates that only a small proportion are likely to be receiving support and that many may not have had their condition diagnosed. The number of people known to social care services only represents a small proportion of the actual number of people with autism.</p>\n<h2>Social Care</h2>\n<p>Reading Borough Council&#8217;s statutory returns to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) record 156 people with autism in Reading receiving support in July 2015.  Figure 2 below shows that the numbers were highest for children and young people, with 40% (62 individuals) of those known to social care are aged 19 or younger. This reflects a trend for increasing numbers of diagnoses in younger age groups and suggests that those in older age groups are less likely to be receiving support.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2. People with Autism known to Reading Borough Council social care by age group (July 2014). </strong></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/4872/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Source: Reading Borough Council statutory return</strong></p>\n<p>Of those adults with autism who met the threshold for social care support, a majority (59%) also had a learning disability.  A smaller percentage (6%) of the autistic adults meeting the eligibility criteria also had a mental health problem.</p>\n<p>Information on the diagnosis pathway for adults with autism shows high demand, with a waiting time of 28-30 weeks for assessment &#8211; an increase on the previous years.  Of those seen for assessment by the service between April 2013 and March 2014, 46% received a diagnosis of autism and 38% received a partial diagnosis of autistic traits.</p>\n<h2>Education</h2>\n<p>Pupils with ASD as a primary need represent a significant proportion of those with a statement of special needs and a higher proportion than average appear to face exclusion. In the 2013-14 academic year, information collected by Reading schools for the Department of Education indicate that 105 pupils in Reading had a Statement of Special Education Needs that identified ASD as the primary need &#8211; 19% of all pupils with a statement.  Of those pupils who were excluded from school during the first two terms of the academic year (September 2013-April 2014), 19 children had ASD as the primary need on their statement. This represents 20% of all exclusions for pupils with a statement and around a fifth of all children with ASD as a primary need.  It also reflects a national trend, with considerable numbers of children with autistic spectrum disorder facing exclusion, including &#8216;unofficial exclusion&#8217; where parents are asked to keep their children at home without officially excluding (National Autistic Society; Ambitious about Autism; Redman et al, 2009).</p>\n<p>Absence rates also appear to be higher than average. For the first two terms of the 2013-14 academic year at Reading schools are recorded as 5.7% for pupils with ASD as the primary need, slightly higher than the 4.6% absence rate for all pupils, although lower than the 7.6% absence rate for all pupils with statement.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that these data reflect only those pupils with an autism diagnosis and a statement that identifies this as their primary need, and not those with a lower level of need or without a diagnosis.  Parents and carers have raised concerns about children with autism being &#8220;unofficially&#8221; excluded, although data isn&#8217;t available to evidence this.</p>\n<h2>National and Local Strategies</h2>\n<p>There are a number of government policies and guidance to support adults with ASD, details of these are generally published by the Department of Health and can be located on their website <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/search?q=autism&amp;tab=government-results\">here</a>. There are however, some very key publications and these are:</p>\n<p>The 2009 Autism Act (HM Government, 2009) and the first national Autism Strategy in 2010, <em>Fulfilling and Rewarding Lives</em> (HM Government, 2014) set the national vision for improving the lives of adults with autism.  The Department of Health (DoH) published the updated <em>Think Autism</em> Strategy in 2014, reaffirming the importance of five areas for action in the original strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increasing awareness and understanding of autism</li>\n<li>Developing clear, consistent pathways for the diagnosis of autism</li>\n<li>Improving access for adults with autism to services and support</li>\n<li>Helping adults with autism into work</li>\n<li>Enabling local partners to develop relevant services</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Care Act 2014 (HM Government) introduces a wide range of changes to care and support for adults, including a national eligibility criteria and updated rules for assessment and support planning.  It gives local authorities a new duty to ensure people can access preventative services and information and advice about care and support.  The Care Act gives carers the right to an assessment of their needs in their own right.</p>\n<p>Whilst there is no equivalent national strategy for children with autism, there are significant changes to the law for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) through Children and Families Act 2014. This includes the introduction of Single Education Health (SEN) Care Plans (EHCPs) to replace SEN statements.  EHCPs last until a person turns 25 to allow for more seamless transition between children and adults services.  Carers of disabled children also gain similar rights to assessment of their needs as outlined in the Care Act<sup>6.</sup></p>\n<p>The National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE) regularly updates its clinical guidelines which advises on the standards of support for people with autism.  These are available on the NICE website <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Reading&#8217;s Autism Strategy for Children, Young People and Adults 2015-18 </em>aims to align existing local plans and strategies across the wide range of areas that provide support for people with autism.  Some of the other key documents for Reading include:</p>\n<p>Health</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s Health &amp; Wellbeing Strategy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children &amp; Young People</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s Special Education Needs and/or Disability (SEND) Strategy</li>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s Early Help Strategy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adults</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s Adult Learning Disability Partnership &#8216;Big Voice&#8217; Workplan</li>\n<li>Berkshire West&#8217;s Joint Commissioning Plan for Services for People with Learning Disabilities and Challenging Behaviour</li>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s Market Position Statement for Adult Social Care</li>\n<li>Reading&#8217;s Prevention Framework and Reading&#8217;s Adult Social Care Information &amp; Advice Plan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>Reading&#8217;s Autism Strategy has helped identify 6 clear local priorities which are aimed at improving the health, wellbeing and support for people with autism in Reading.  These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Priority 1 &#8211; Increasing awareness and understanding of autism</li>\n<li>Priority 2 &#8211;  Improving access to diagnosis and beyond</li>\n<li>Priority 3 &#8211; Support better life outcomes for people with autism</li>\n<li>Priority 4 &#8211; Support people with autism to live safely and independently as possible</li>\n<li>Priority 5 &#8211; Support families and carers of people with autism</li>\n<li>Priority 6 &#8211;  Improve how we plan and manage support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are generally consistent with the key areas of action identified in the National Autism Strategy <em>Fulfilling and rewarding lives</em> (HM Government, 2014). Reading&#8217;s local Strategy forms the basis for a local action plan, which is overseen by Reading&#8217;s Health and Wellbeing Board.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>Autism is a serious and often disabling condition and without the right diagnosis and support, can often result in disparities in someone life. These inequalities can be educational, health, social and employment for example there is national evidence that shows that only 15% of people diagnosed with autism in the UK are in full-time paid employment.  A high proportion of students excluded from school have been diagnosed with autism (Redman et al, 2009). One in three adults report experiencing severe mental health difficulties due to the lack of appropriate support.  It is also reasonable to conclude that many people with autism are socially isolated from parts or all of the mainstream communities in which they live and, not necessarily by choice.</p>\n<p>Nationally it is estimated that a high number of people with autism remain undiagnosed and evidence suggests that more awareness of the condition is needed in order to reduce inequalities experienced by those without a diagnosis and support to manage their condition.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/learning-disabilities/\">Learning Disabilities</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/general-wellbeing/\">General Wellbeing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/mental-health/\">Mental health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/housing-and-homelessness/\">Housing and Homelessness</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/employment/\">Employment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/jsna/carers\">Carers</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Ambitious about Autism.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>According to the <em>World Health Organisation</em>, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is resistance of a <em>microorganism</em> to an antimicrobial drug that was originally effective for treatment of infections caused by it. Resistant <em>microorganisms</em> (including bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites) are able to withstand attack by antimicrobial drugs, so that standard treatments become ineffective and infections persist. Alternative medications or higher doses are therefore required &#8211; which may be more costly or more toxic &#8211; or treatment fails altogether. AMR is therefore a broader issue than bacterial antibiotic resistance alone, but the scope of this chapter is limited largely to the latter &#8211; as this is perhaps of greatest concern</p>\n<h2>Antibiotic Resistance:</h2>\n<p>The initial evolution of resistant microorganism strains is a natural phenomenon that occurs when they replicate themselves erroneously (a mutation) or when resistant traits are exchanged between them. The use/misuse of antimicrobial drugs then accelerates the emergence of drug-resistant strains.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6656/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>The circles indicate individual bacteria. A yellow bacteria is very sensitive to Antibiotic X, meaning treatment will be successful. A red bacteria is more resistant to Antibiotic X, meaning they may only be sensitive at higher doses/to a longer course of treatment, or treatment may be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"bacteria diagram\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6679/bacteria-diagram/image/Changes_to_bacteria_due_to_antibiotics_1.PNG\" alt=\"bacteria diagram \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">bacteria diagram</span></span></p>\n<p>Antibiotic misuse contributes to resistance in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure to Complete Course of Antibiotics</li>\n<li>Consider that the bacteria in question are all E coli, a common cause of urinary tract infections, and an appropriate antibiotic is correctly prescribed</li>\n<li>Some of the individual E coli carry a natural resistance to this antibiotic, meaning they won&#8217;t be killed immediately, but the majority will be, leaving a very small amount of the pathogen left &#8211; with pressure selection meaning they are likely to be more resistant to treatment</li>\n<li>If the patient forgets to, or purposefully does not complete the full course of antibiotics, these remaining bacteria are then able to replicate and re-colonise, meaning not only does the infection return, but is now resistant to the original treatment (not only in this patient &#8211; but to anyone else who catches it)</li>\n<li>Inappropriate Prescription/Consumption of Antibiotics for Non-bacterial Infections</li>\n<li>Consider instead that the bacteria are a mixture of different bacteria, none of which are currently/will ever cause infection, and are simply part of the natural flora (ecological community)</li>\n<li>If an antibiotic is prescribed for an unrelated illness (for example a viral infection), these bacteria will still undergo this pressure selection, and will still develop resistance to this antibiotic.</li>\n<li>If at a later date this bacteria does cause an infection, or it passes its now-resistant genes to another bacteria, treatment with the same antibiotic will be unsuccessful</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>AMR is a rapidly growing public health threat for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The use of antimicrobials has increased so that microbes are exposed to a much larger number/greater concentration of antimicrobials, increasing their chances of developing resistance.</li>\n<li>For some categories of antimicrobials (particularly antibiotics) there are very limited numbers of new drugs under development to replace those rendered ineffective by rising drug resistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, the demand for new drugs has increased but the supply has dried up. Infections with resistant organisms now occur both in community and hospital populations. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that antibiotics add 20 years to average life expectancy. Currently AMR is responsible for 700,000 deaths per year worldwide but by 2050, it could kill someone every three seconds. In a keynote address at a conference on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO stated:</p>\n<p>&#8220;If current trends continue unabated, the future is easy to predict. Some experts say we are moving back to the pre-antibiotic era. No. This will be a post-antibiotic era. In terms of new replacement antibiotics, the pipeline is virtually dry. The cupboard is nearly bare. A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it. Things as common as strep throat or a child&#8217;s scratched knee could once again kill&#8221;</p>\n<p>Though AMR occurs across many strains of bacteria and to a wide range of antibiotics, examples of more noteworthy AMR organisms in England include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)\n<ul>\n<li>MRSA is any strain of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) that has developed multi- resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which include the penicillins and the cephalosporins.</li>\n<li>Through effective prevention and control, the proportion MRSA blood stream infections has fallen from 15% in 2010 to 8% in 2014 (according to DoH data).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) toxin\n<ul>\n<li>Increases in isolates of MRSA producing the PVL toxin (a toxin associated with severe infection) have been observed among submissions to PHE&#8217;s national reference laboratory, with 117 isolated in 2005 increasing to 1049 isolates in 2010.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Extended-spectrum β-Lactamases (ESBLs)\n<ul>\n<li>ESBLs are enzymes that confer resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics. ESBLs are commonly multi-resistant, and are frequently encoded on mobile plasmids (which transfer this resistance between different strains or even to other species of bacteria).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)\n<ul>\n<li>CPE are bacteria that are resistant to the carbapenem class of antibiotics and have emerged in the UK over the past decade. Enterobacteriaceae are a large family of bacteria that includes perhaps most importantly E coli, but also salmonella, Yersinia, Klebsiella and Shigella.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Public Perception</h2>\n<p>It is well understood that a key part of the battle against AMR will be public perception and, to this end, research has been carried out world-wide exploring what is generally understood around the subject. The Wellcome Trust recently commissioned work to explore the British public&#8217;s relationship with antibiotics. This revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General confusion regarding AMR terminology. Perhaps unsurprisingly, no-one in the focus groups was familiar with the abbreviation &#8220;AMR&#8221;, but &#8220;antimicrobial resistance&#8221; also drew blank faces, and even &#8220;antibiotic resistance&#8221; left the vast majority of participants confused.</li>\n<li>Many incorrectly believed that it is the patient who builds up a resistance to antibiotics, rather than the bacteria itself.</li>\n<li>They felt overuse of antibiotics was only harming their chances of future success with treatment, not the wider community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The study also found that, even with nomenclature clarified, there were still vast misconceptions about appropriate antibiotic use &#8211; findings that were shared in a similar survey of the American general public. Many people felt validated when they were prescribed antibiotics, commenting, &#8220;It confirms I&#8217;m ill&#8221;, others thought of antibiotics as &#8220;a magic pill&#8221; to help them get better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the states, over 40% of respondents indicated that antibiotics were the best choice of treatment for a fever, runny nose or sore throat.</li>\n<li>According to a UK Department of Health sponsored survey (where 43% incorrectly agreed that &#8216;antibiotics can kill viruses&#8217;), those who were prescribed antibiotics for inappropriate reasons were more likely to re-present and request antibiotics the next time they fell ill. Further:\n<ul>\n<li>4 in 10 people with a cough or symptoms of a cold, and 6 in 10 people with a throat infection had taken antibiotics in the previous years.</li>\n<li>17% believed that antibiotics could be used as an anti-inflammatory agent; 4% believed they can treat asthma, 4% that they can treat hay fever and 4% that they can treat headaches. More than 1 in 10 believed they can be used to treat allergic reactions and 26% that they can treat fungal infections</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps more worryingly, this same Department of Health survey demonstrated even those with better understanding of AMR were just as likely to use antibiotics inappropriately. Though sometimes increased knowledge was associated with more prudent use (more likely to complete a course of antibiotics), sometimes it was associated with more irresponsible activity (more likely to self-medicate and to keep left-over antibiotics for future use).</p>\n<p>Even when AMR is well understood, and antibiotics are used responsibly, the scale of the issue is seemingly missed. In the American study discussed, the vast majority agreed that inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to antibiotic resistance (92%), but most (70%) felt that AMR was not a major problem.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>In 2016, the Department of Health updated their Antimicrobial Resistance Empirical and Statistical Evidence-Base. In this they discuss increasing antibiotic use and trends in AMR.</p>\n<p>Increased use of antibiotics is the primary driver for the development of resistance. The standard measure of use (prescribing) is Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 1000 population. The majority of antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, but in secondary care, broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as cephalosporin, quinolones and co-amoxiclav) are prescribed. Broad spectrum antibiotics are effective against a wide range of bacteria, but are more likely to drive resistance. As will be discussed in greater detail below, a key aim of the current UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy is the conservation and stewarding of currently available antibiotics &#8211; this means reducing the number of prescriptions, particularly the number of broad-spectrum prescriptions.</p>\n<h3>Nationally</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The 2014 English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR) report showed:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>From 2010-2013, the total use of antibiotics increased by 6%. 2014 data shows prescribing of antibiotics continuing to increase &#8211; though at a slower rate (2.4%).</li>\n<li>The predominant antibiotics used were penicillins (around 13 DDDs per 1000 inhabitants/day), tetracyclines and macrolides (around 4 DDDs per inhabitant/day)</li>\n<li>There is increasing use of both carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam</li>\n<li>There is decreasing use of both cephalosporins and quinolones</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The 2011 National Point Prevalence Survey collected information on 52,443 patients :</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The total number of antimicrobials prescribed was 25,942 to a total of 18,219 patients.</li>\n<li>34.7% of patients were thus prescribed antimicrobials, who then received 1.42 types of antimicrobial.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Locally</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Public Health England has local data available regarding Antibiotic Prescribing, which can be broken down by CCG.</li>\n<li>CCGs can be compared with other similar ones around the country, most usefully being grouped by deprivation decile and CCG cluster.</li>\n<li>Reading Local Authority contains North and West Reading CCG , which falls into the &#8216;Second Least Deprived&#8217; deprivation decile, and the &#8216;Less deprived areas with better health&#8217; CCG cluster, and South Reading CCG, which falls &#8216;Fifth Less Deprived&#8217; deprivation decile, and the &#8216;Young adults and university cities&#8217; CCG cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Figures 1 &amp; 2 reflect the trends (2010 Quarter 1-2016 Quarter 1) in &#8216;Total number of prescribed antibiotic items per 1000 resident individuals by quarter&#8217; for the two CCGs, while Figures 3 &amp; 4 compare the 2016 Q1 data for the CCGs, to their Deprivation Decile and CCG cluster.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: North &amp; West Reading CCG &#8211; Total number of prescribed antibiotic items per 1000 resident individuals by quarter</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image5\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6667/image5/image/image5.png\" alt=\"image5 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 2: South Reading CCG &#8211; Total number of prescribed antibiotic items per 1000 resident individuals by quarter</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image6\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6668/image6/image/image6.png\" alt=\"image6 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 3: Figure 3: North &amp; West Reading CCG &#8211; Total number of prescribed antibiotic items per 1000 resident individuals in 2016 Q1 &#8211; comparing CCG value, Deprivation Decile and CCG cluster</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image7\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6669/image7/image/image7.png\" alt=\"image7 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 4: Figure 3: North &amp; West Reading CCG &#8211; Total number of prescribed antibiotic items per 1000 resident individuals in 2016 Q1 &#8211; comparing CCG value, Deprivation Decile and CCG cluster</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image8\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6670/image8/image/image8.png\" alt=\"image8 \" /></span></p>\n<p>The above Figures show the rate of antibiotic drug consumption in the CCG by quarter by taking into account all prescribing at the primary care level.

There is a clear trend of proportionally reduced consumption of these drugs in both CCGs. Further, both CCGs see proportionally fewer prescriptions of these drugs than its comparative areas &#8211; suggesting appropriate antimicrobial stewardship.</p>\n<h3>Trends</h3>\n<p>The aim of antimicrobial stewardship is to reduce the proportion of bacteria that are resistant to treatment. Data on resistance and trends is most frequently obtained from surveillance systems though, and there are a number of limitations to this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are invariably incomplete because to detect examples of AMR requires laboratory isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of a disease-causing pathogen &#8211; which is often not necessary for the clinical management of a patient (especially in the community).</li>\n<li>It is usually implicitly assumed that trends observed in reported isolates (i.e. where infection has occurred) reflect those occurring in the wider population of (healthy) patients and pathogens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No local information is available, but the 2015 ESPAUR report and also the annual progress report of the UKs current AMR strategy reviewed the national incidence of infection and the proportion of resistance.</p>\n<p>The ESPAUR report found that from 2010 to 2014:</p>\n<p>The incidence of</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections increased</li>\n<li>K. oxytoca, Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp., S. aureus and Acinetobacter spp. bloodstream infections remained constant</li>\n<li>Streptococcus pneumoniae bloodstream infections declined</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding resistance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Though proportionally, resistant to key drugs (e.g. ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and imipenem) have remained constant in E. coli, increased incidence of infections means that more individuals have had a significant antibiotic-resistant infection. Further, statistically significant increases in resistance were found to cefotaxime, co-amoxiclav and piperacillin/tazobactam.</li>\n<li>The increases in both incidence and antibiotic resistance (to cefotaxime, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam) observed in K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections means that the number of individuals with antibiotic-resistant infections has increased substantially.</li>\n<li>Statistically significant increases in proportions of resistance were also noted in Enterococcus spp. (to vancomycin), but decreases were noted in S. aureus (to methicillin).</li>\n<li>Resistance in pseudomonas spp., streptococcus pneumonia, gonorrhoea and tuberculosis (TB) have remained stable, though they remain a significant threat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Department of Health update showed that between 2013 and 2014:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With the exception of Pseudomonas spp., where resistance to carbapenems showed a statistically significant increase, the proportions of isolates of each species resistant to each antibiotic were generally stable.</li>\n<li>Again however, the increased incidence of some infections (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) means that for these infections the actual numbers of resistant infections is increasing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>National &amp; Local Strategies</h3>\n<p>The importance of AMR has been recognised now for many years. In an interview shortly after winning the Nobel Prize in 1945 for discovering Penicillin, Alexander Fleming said:</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of the man who succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first World Health Assembly AMR resolution was agreed in 1998 and the need to accelerate progress has been acknowledged by both the WHO and European Commission. The first UK AMR Strategy was published in 2000 and the most recent update was a five year strategy released in 2013.</p>\n<p>This represented an ambitious programme to slow the development and spread of AMR and rested on the three pillars of prevent, protect and promote: preventing infection, protecting the antibiotics that we have (stewardship) and promoting the development of new drugs and alternative treatments. Examples of actions currently taken to Tackle AMR in the UK are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raising Awareness &#8211; The European Antibiotic Awareness Day on the 18th November and World Antibiotic Awareness Week from the 14th-20th November (2016) is held each year to raise awareness among health professionals and the public of AMR and appropriate prescribing.</li>\n<li>Optimising prescribing in Primary Care &#8211; To provide support for GPs who are often pressured into giving antibiotics by patients expecting to receive them, a toolkit &#8211; Treat Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance and Education Tool (TARGET) was developed by the Health Protection Agency. Another similar initiative &#8211; Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) includes resources for clinicians to share with the public during consultations.</li>\n<li>Improving antibiotic prescribing in primary care is key part of the 2016-17 Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) programme. This focuses on reducing the number of antibiotics prescribed in primary care through either a 4% (or greater) reduction on 2013/14 performance OR equal to (or below) the England 2013/14 mean performance, reducing the number of Co-amoxiclav, Cephalosporins and Quinolones (antibiotics associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection) as a proportion of the total number of selected antibiotics prescribed in primary care to be equal to or lower than 10%, OR to reduce by 20% from each CCG&#8217;s 2014/15 value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These measures are underpinned by authoritative, evidence based guidance developed by NICE and also appear in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) and supported by the 3 CCGs of Berkshire East (Bracknell &amp; Ascot, Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough) in their Operational Plan 2016/17 and by the 4 CCGs of Berkshire West (Wokingham, Newbury and District, South Reading and North and West Reading) in theirs. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working with the local health economy to set up an Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) group which will be looking all aspects of AMS, including having a joint strategy that spans primary, secondary and community care</li>\n<li>Evidence based prescribing, audit programme and education and training</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2015, all 7 CCGs agreed to prescribing guidelines for use in primary care:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The guidelines promote the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics in preference to broad</li>\n<li>The audience of users is anticipated to be general practitioners, GP trainees, GP practice nurses, non-medical prescribers, paramedics, hospital emergency department staff and community pharmacists.</li>\n<li>Optimising prescribing in Hospitals &#8211; AMR is tackled in hospitals primarily via reduced transmission (e.g. hand hygiene) and reduced deployment of resistance (e.g. antimicrobial stewardship). Resources like Start Smart then Focus have helped provide guidance on antibiotic stewardship and encourage use of the right drug, right dose and right duration. This is supported by The Berkshire NHS Foundation Trusts Operational Plan 2016/17. The Trust has a programme of education and training on antibiotic prescribing and stewardship. This utilises the MicroGuide app for mobile devices and includes developing a local antibiotic consumption vs resistance monitoring system; greater antibiotic auditing and real-time feedback to prescribers.</li>\n<li>AMR Research &#8211; The UK is helping to shape thinking on AMR and helping develop an international framework of action to harness contributions from all sectors and encourage collaborative working. More information on AMR research is available at Antibiotic research UK, and a good summary of past and present UK AMR research is found in the UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013 to 2018</li>\n<li>Prescribing in the Veterinary Sector &#8211; Antibiotic use is not limited to humans and large quantities of antimicrobials are used in veterinary practice and the fishing and farming industries. While the current evidence suggests that this is not a major cause of resistance in bacteria that affect human health, it does provide a further vehicle for the development of antimicrobial resistance. To this end, there are a number of initiatives to promote the responsible use of antibiotics in animals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy (2013 to 2018) lists 7 key areas for future action:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improving infection prevention and control practices in human and animal health, both through enhanced dissemination and implementation of best practice and better use of data and diagnostics</li>\n<li>Optimising prescribing practice through implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes that promote rational prescribing and better use of existing and new rapid diagnostics</li>\n<li>Improving professional education, training and public engagement to improve clinical practice and promote wider understanding of the need for more sustainable use of antibiotics</li>\n<li>Developing new drugs, treatments and diagnostics through better collaboration between research councils, academia, industry and others; and by encouraging greater public-private investment in the discovery and development of a sustainable supply of effective new antimicrobials, rapid diagnostics, and complementary tools for use in health, social care, and veterinary systems</li>\n<li>Better access to and use of surveillance data in human and animal sectors through new arrangements that facilitate greater consistency and standardisation of the data collected across the system and encourage improved data linkage</li>\n<li>Better identification and prioritisation of AMR research needs to focus activity and inform our understanding of AMR. This may identify alternative treatments to new drugs as well as new or improved rapid or point-of-care diagnostic tests for humans and animals</li>\n<li>Strengthened international collaboration working with and through a wide range of governmental and non-governmental organisations, international regulatory bodies and others to influence opinion, galvanise support, and mobilise action to deliver the scale of change needed globally</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Early in 2016, Lord O&#8217;Neill, who led a government review on AMR, called for a £1.5 billion investment in global innovation funding for research by 2020. On 21st September 2016, the United Nations held a High Level Meeting On Antimicrobial Resistance to &#8220;summon and maintain strong national, regional and international political commitment in addressing antimicrobial resistance comprehensively and multi-sectorally, and to increase and improve awareness of antimicrobial resistance.&#8221; The signatories now have two years to report back with an action plan.</p>\n<h3>What is this telling us?</h3>\n<p>AMR is a vitally important yet poorly understood issue that requires urgent focus at local and national level. We can&#8217;t stop bugs becoming resistant to antibiotics, but we can slow the process down. Though certain patient populations, prescribing practices and environments may contribute to resistance more than others, AMR does not then discriminate &#8211; it will affect everyone &#8211; and everyone has a part to play.</p>\n<h3>What are we doing in Berkshire?</h3>\n<p>Recently, a Berkshire-wide AMR stewardship group with representatives from all the main trusts in primary and secondary care has been established. The aim of the group is to concentrate and amalgamate efforts to comply with the strategies listed above. As well as working to improve awareness and understanding of AMR, a good example of this is the Antibiotic Guardian campaign.</p>\n<p>Antibiotic Guardian is a PHE-led drive to encourage improved behaviours and engagement on the prudent use and prescription of antibiotics with members of the public and healthcare professionals. Antibiotic Guardians sign up online, and in doing so choose one pledge about how they can personally prevent infections, or make better use of antibiotics. You can be a healthcare professional, a student or educator, or a member of the general public and though PHE were aiming to reach 100,000 Antibiotic Guardians by March 2016, at time of writing, the current pledge count was 32,975.</p>\n<p>Public Health England has local data available regarding &#8216;Antibiotic Guardians per 100,000 population per year&#8217; as a measure of engagement within the area on antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic Guardians submit half-postcodes during their signup, which are then matched to their CCG catchment area by calendar year.</p>\n<p>For the Reading Local Authority (including parts of North and West Reading and South Reading CCGs), Figures 9/10 and 11/12 show the level of engagement with this programme. Using data from the aforementioned PHE profiles, Figures 9/10 show the amount of antibiotic guardians in 2013 and 2014, while Figures 11/12 compare this data to the appropriate deprivation decile and CCG cluster grouping.</p>\n<p>Figure 9: North &amp; West Reading CCG &#8211; Antibiotic Guardians per 100,000 population per calendar year by CCGs</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image13\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6660/image13/image/image13.png\" alt=\"image13 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 10: South Reading CCG &#8211; Antibiotic Guardians per 100,000 population per calendar year by CCGs</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image14\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6661/image14/image/image14.png\" alt=\"image14 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 11: North &amp; West Reading CCG &#8211; Antibiotic Guardians per 100,000 population per calendar year by CCGs &#8211; comparing CCG value, Deprivation Decile and CCG cluster data</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image15\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6662/image15/image/image15_1.png\" alt=\"image15 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Figure 12: South Reading CCG &#8211; Antibiotic Guardians per 100,000 population per calendar year by CCGs &#8211; comparing CCG value, Deprivation Decile and CCG cluster data</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image16\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6663/image16/image/image16.png\" alt=\"image16 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately the number of Antibiotic Guardians dropped from 2014-15 for both CCGs. North and West Reading CCG compares poorly to other similar areas (CCG cluster and Deprivation Decile). Though Antibiotic Guardians dropped from 2014-15 in South Reading CCG, it actually compares well to other similar areas (CCG cluster and Deprivation Decile).</p>\n<h3>What are the key inequalities?</h3>\n<p>As stated, AMR does not discriminate. Many factors have and will contribute to its impact, but it will impact everyone. It is impossible to predict the path of emerging drug resistance, but it is a trend that has largely run only in one direction so far. What we can be certain of is that, in the absence of interventions to slow the emergence of resistance, the impacts will be felt not just in isolated areas but at a far more fundamental level, across our societies and healthcare systems.</p>\n<p>Though antibiotics are primarily used to treat infection, they also play a key role prophylactically in reducing life threatening complications in surgery, chemotherapy and transplantation. In the past, resistant infections were associated predominantly with hospitals and care settings, but over the last decade resistant infections have been seen in the wider community too.</p>\n<p>Though certain patient populations may thus be affected by AMR earlier than others (e.g. elderly populations or chronic disease groups), even everyday infections that we now seen as trivial may once again soon be deadly.</p>\n<p>Before the availability antimicrobials there was greater inequality in health. Will the restriction of antimicrobials, and the rise of AMR, mean a return to greater health inequalities?</p>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<p>In May 2015, the Sixty-eight World Health Assembly adopted the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance. Within this are the Global Strategy Recommendations. Although the full list is available here &#8211; and contains advice for national governments and health systems &#8211; recommendations appropriate to the UK and Reading include:</p>\n<p>Residents</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Washing your hands</li>\n<li>Avoiding contact with sick people, or using the appropriate personal protective equipment</li>\n<li>Keeping current with vaccinations (humans and animals)</li>\n<li>Using antibiotic appropriately and as instructed by your doctor &#8211; finish prescribed courses, do not share antibiotics and do not feel every infection requires them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Local Authority</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure sanitary conditions are maintained</li>\n<li>Raise awareness of AMR and antimicrobial stewardship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prescribers and Dispensers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage prescribers and dispensers to educate patients on antimicrobial use and the importance of adherence to prescribed treatments.</li>\n<li>Improve antimicrobial use by supervision and support of clinical practices, especially diagnostic and treatment strategies.</li>\n<li>Audit prescribing and dispensing practices and utilize peer group or external standard comparisons to provide feedback and endorsement of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PHE</p>\n<p>PHE centres should ensure that the ESPAUR report is discussed at meetings, local Quality Surveillance Groups, strategic clinical networks, health protection committees, local infection prevention and control committees.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide access to AMR data to relevant stakeholders</li>\n<li>Promote the use of surveillance systems and the Antibiotic Guardian call to action</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Access to antenatal and newborn screening for Reading residents is safe and performance against key indicators is in line or better than the national average. In some areas, performance exceeds the national average and reaches the most effective levels of performance.</p>\n<p>Antenatal tests are designed to make pregnancy safer and check and assess the development of the baby. Women should be provided with full information about the conditions being tested for and encouraged to make an informed decision about screening (NICE, 2014; NHS Choices). Those who are not offered screening, or do not feel adequately informed to confidently take up screening, may be at risk of complications in pregnancy and early infancy.</p>\n<p>Currently, we have little information about local patterns and trends in screening uptake, especially whether any particular groups of residents appear to be less likely to receive screening, whether this is by choice or the result of lack of access, and what interventions could be put in place to improve performance even further.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Antenatal screening programmes are offered to pregnant women to test for certain health issues in unborn children. Standard checks include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood tests to detect infectious diseases that could cause harm during pregnancy &#8211; Hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis and immunity to rubella</li>\n<li>Blood tests and ultrasound scan to assess the chance that the baby could have Down&#8217;s syndrome (also called &#8216;Trisomy 21 or T21), Patau&#8217;s syndrome (or Trisomy 13 or T13) and Edward&#8217;s syndrome (Trisomy 18 or T18).</li>\n<li>Blood test to detect sickle cell disease and thalassaemia.</li>\n<li>Detailed ultrasound scan to check for any physical abnormalities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Screening for newborn babies are also offered to detect physical abnormalities and health issues that can be detected via a blood test. The tests offered help to detect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical examinations, including checks of the eyes, heart, hips and testes</li>\n<li>A hearing test</li>\n<li>A blood spot test to check if the baby has any of nine rare conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The NHS Antenatal and newborn screening timeline provides more information about screening, including the weeks that screening checks should be carried out, with an <a href=\"https://cpdscreening.phe.org.uk/elearning\">e-learning module</a> including further information to understand the checks offered.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures, Trends</h2>\n<p>Antenatal and newborn screening is provided by maternity units and all activity and performance are reported accordingly. The maternity unit at the Royal Berkshire Hospital has patients from a wide area and the majority of Reading residents are likely to use the unit for their maternity care. Key performance indicators for the NHS screening programmes are published on a quarterly basis. These include the antenatal and newborn screening programmes mentioned above. Recent information about national and local performance against these indicators is provided below.</p>\n<h3>Antenatal infections disease screening</h3>\n<p>As described above, all pregnant women are offered screening for four infections: Hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis and susceptibility to rubella. If infected, women are offered care and treatment to reduce the risk of passing the infection to their baby, and to protect their own health and wellbeing. Women who are rubella susceptible are offered the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination to protect future pregnancies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nationally, 99.1% of pregnant women eligible for infectious disease screening were tested for HIV in 2015/16. This is an increase from 98.7% in 2014/15 exceeded the level that is considered to be acceptable and safe.</li>\n<li>73.6% of pregnant women in the UK who were Hepatitis B positive were referred and seen by an appropriate specialist within an effective timeframe (6 weeks from identification) in 2015/16. This met the national target level of 70% and represents an increase from 65.1% in 2014/15. Healthcare trusts providing services in the South of England reached 85.3%, an increase from 71.6% in the previous year. All 21 Hepatitis B positive women who were seen at the Royal Berkshire Hospital were referred within 6 weeks.</li>\n<li>99.6% of eligible pregnant women were screened for HIV at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in 2015/16. Performance against this indicator is consistently high and above the targets for safe performance (90%) and effective performance (95%) (Figure 1) (PHE, 2016).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Figure 1: Antenatal screening coverage for HIV infection at Royal Berkshire Hospital (2011/12 &#8211; 2015/16)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image1\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6753/image1/image/image1.png\" alt=\"image1 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: UK National Screening Committee (published August 2016)</p>\n<h3>Screening for Down&#8217;s Syndrome</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>96.9% of Down&#8217;s syndrome screening laboratory request forms nationally were submitted to the laboratory within the recommended timeframes of 10 and 20 weeks of gestation in 2015/16. This was below the acceptable level of 97% and had not improved from 2014/15 (96.5%).</li>\n<li>In 2015/16 Down&#8217;s syndrome screening at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, as measured by completed laboratory request forms, was similar to the national average at 96.6%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Antenatal sickle Cell &amp; Thalassaemia Screening</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>98.7% of pregnant women eligible for antenatal sickle cell and thalassaemia screening in the UK had a conclusive screening result available at the day of report in 2015/16. This is above the acceptable safe level of 95% and just below the achievable level of 99%, which is seen as the level at which the programme is running effectively. This is similar to 2014/15 (98.5%)</li>\n<li>99.5% of eligible pregnant women at Royal Berkshire had conclusive screening results available at the day of report in 2015/16. Screening coverage is now consistently high and above the targets for safe performance (95%) and effective performance (99%) (Figure 2).</li>\n<li>50.7% of women in the UK having antenatal sickle cell and thalassaemia screening had a conclusive screening result available by 10 weeks gestation in 2015/16. This is considered above the safe level of performance (50%) but falls well below level of performance that would be considered effective (75%). National performance against this target has fallen slightly from 51.6% in 2014/15.</li>\n<li>58.5% of women at the Royal Berkshire Hospital had a conclusive screening result available by 10 weeks gestation in 2015/16. Although this exceeds the national average and indicates that performance is considered safe, it continues to be well below the target for effective performance (75%).</li>\n<li>96.5% of antenatal sickle cell and thalassaemia samples submitted to the laboratory were supported by a completed Family Origin Questionnaire (FOQ) in 2015/16. This exceeds the level of effective performance of 95%. Performance at the Royal Berkshire Hospital fell slightly below this level, but exceeded the level of performance considered safe (90%).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Figure 2: Antenatal screening coverage for sickle cell and thalesseamia at Royal Berkshire Hospital (2011/12 &#8211; 2015/16)</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/6754/image2/image/image2.png\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p>Source: UK National Screening Committee (published August 2016)</p>\n<h3>Newborn Hearing Screening</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2015/16 98.4% of babies in the UK eligible for newborn hearing screening in the UK had the screening completed by 4 weeks (hospital programmes-well babies, NICU (neonatal intensive care babies) babies) or by 5 weeks (community programmes-well babies). This represents a slight increase from 98% in 2014/15.</li>\n<li>88.3% of referred babies in the UK received audiological assessment within 4 weeks of the decision that referral for assessment is required or by 44 weeks gestational age. This represents a slight increase from 87.7% in 2014/15.</li>\n<li>In 2015/16 97.2% of babies eligible for newborn hearing screening by the Royal Berkshire Hospital had the screening completed in the appropriate timescale. This exceeds the level considered safe (95%) but falls short of the target for effective performance (99.5%). 90.3% were referred for an audiological assessment within 4 weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Newborn and infant physical examinations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>94.4% of babies in the UK eligible for newborn physical examination had the full test within 72 hours of birth in 2015/16. This was below the target for safe performance of 95%.</li>\n<li>48.6% of UK babies who were referred for further investigation of a possible clinical abnormality of the hips, underwent a further assessment by specialist hip ultrasound within two weeks of birth.</li>\n<li>In 2015/16 97.7% of babies eligible for newborn physical examination by the Royal Berkshire Hospital had the full test within 72 hours of birth. This is better than the national average and exceeds the target for safe performance of 95%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Newborn Bloodspot Screening</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2015/16 96.2% of babies in the UK eligible for blood spot screening had a conclusive result recorded within an effective timeframe (17 days of age). This was above the target for safe practice of 95%. However, 3.6% of these tests had to be repeated, due to avoidable failure in the sampling. This was over the acceptable level of 2%.</li>\n<li>In the same period performance against this indicator by GP practices under both North and West and South Reading CCGs (98.5% and 98.1% respectively) exceeded both the national average and the target for safe performance of 95%.

    "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Reading has evolved from the town&#8217;s manufacturing origins of beer, bulbs and biscuits to its current role as the service and financial centre of the Thames Valley. Strategically located as a major transport hub and in close proximity to Heathrow, Reading is now home to the largest concentration of information and communications technology corporations in the UK. Key companies based in the area include Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Prudential Assurance, with many more just outside the borough&#8217;s constrained administrative boundaries.</p>\n<p>This transformation is particularly evident in the centre of the town and Reading has become a top destination for retail and entertainment. The Reading of today is a sub-regional capital attracting large numbers of workers, shoppers and visitors from a wide area, adding to the vitality and success of the town, but at the same time putting extra pressure on the transport network in turn impacting on air quality across the borough.</p>\n<p>the source apportionment studies have identified road traffic as the major source in the Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) hotspots. An Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) has been declared along all the main arterial roads in and out of the centre of Reading.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Reading economy is service sector based, however there are a small number of industrial premises, some of which require regulation and permitting under Pollution Control legislation.</p>\n<h2>What do we know?</h2>\n<p>Air quality in Reading is generally good. However, there are areas close to congested roads where levels of nitrogen dioxide exceed the air quality objectives and where levels of particulates are elevated. Particulates are classified by their mass (PM10 and PM2.5), with the smaller particulates, PM2.5 being more harmful due to their ability to travel further into the lung.</p>\n<p>PM2.5 is understood to have no safe limit for health, it is therefore beneficial to reduce levels at all locations, not just hotspots that break a set limit.</p>\n<p>New targets in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-air-quality-strategy-for-england-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland-volume-1\">UK Air Quality Strategy</a> set a 25μg/m3 &#8216;cap&#8217; for hotspots and a 15% reduction in PM2.5 levels in all urban locations by 2020.</p>\n<h2>Facts, Figures and Trends</h2>\n<p>A report published by <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140505104658/http:/www.comeap.org.uk/images/stories/Documents/Statements/FINAL_Local_mortality_burden_statement_August_2012.pdf\">The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP) in 2010</a> estimated the number of deaths in the UK attributable to exposure to particulate air pollution to be 29,000.</p>\n<p>New evidence is emerging that NO2 may have health impacts on a similar scale to those of PM.</p>\n<p>Public Health England published a report in 2014: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/332854/PHE_CRCE_010.pdf\">Estimating local mortality burdens associated with particulate air pollution,</a> which used the COMEAP data from 2008 to estimate the percentage of deaths linked to particulate air pollution in local authority areas. In the report, the estimated percentage of deaths attributable to particulate air pollution in Reading is 5.9% of the population over 25, which equates to an estimated 62 deaths in 2008. The report does reflect that these figures are impacted by ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) and therefore the actual levels could range from one sixth to about double these figures.</p>\n<p>Department of Health figures comparing the impact on life expectancy from reductions in fine particles (PM2.5) against elimination of road traffic accidents and passive smoking show that there are significant benefits to tackling man made particulate pollution.</p>\n<h2>National &amp; Local Strategies (Current best practices)</h2>\n<p>Part IV of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69348/pb13566-laqm-policy-guidance-part4-090302.pdf\">Environment Act 1995</a> requires Local Authorities (LAs) to review and assess whether air quality objectives will be achieved. Where they are not an Air Quality management area must be declared and an Action Plan put in place. We are in the process of updating our Action Plan.</p>\n<p>An Updating and Screening Assessment has been undertaken by Reading Borough Council (RBC). It forms part of the sixth round of Air Quality Review and Assessment.</p>\n<p>It follows the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs&#8217; (DEFRA) checklists and guidance for screening for potential exceedance of the National Air Quality Objectives (NAQOs) for the pollutants included in the Air Quality Regulations. It has reviewed new monitoring data and changes to sources and receptors since the previous round of Review and Assessment. DN: Add</p>\n<p>Since the 2013 Progress Report there have been no changes to the Reading automatic monitoring network. Reading continues to own and operate three roadside continuous units; Caversham Road to the north, Kings Road to the east, and Oxford Road to the west. All three monitoring sites measure PM10 using Beta-Attenuation Mass (BAM) analysers, with data corrected using the appropriate correction factor (multiplication factor 0.83) and NO2 using chemiluminescent analysers. All sites are roadside, and are also in close proximity to residential receptors for long-term national air quality objective comparison.</p>\n<h2>What is this telling us?</h2>\n<p>As in the previous rounds of review and assessment, monitoring data has shown that the main pollutant of concern, exceeding the Nitrogen Dioxide National Air Quality Objective (NAQO). Although there have been exceedances of the hourly objective in the past, monitoring data from 2014 has not exceeded this objective.</p>\n<p>There were 30 sites where an exceedance of the 40g/m3 annual mean was seen. A further 14 sites were indicating a borderline exceedance (&gt;36g/m3) in 2014. All sites which were showing either an exceedance or a borderline exceedance were located within the current AQMA boundaries as formally declared in April 2009, therefore no detailed assessment will be required.</p>\n<p>Monitoring data for PM10 collected at the Caversham Road and Kings Road continuous analysers indicates an exceedance of the 24hour objective (more than 35 exceedances of 50 μg/m3), when calculated using the 90th percentile method due to low data capture (87% and 88% respectively).</p>\n<p>There are a number of possible reasons for this occurrence. A factor that may have had an impact on the pollution levels at the Caversham Road Air Quality Management System (AQMS) is the recently completed expansion of Reading Station and Cow Lane Bridges widening. Because of this work a large number of haulage vehicles have been using the route which may have impacted the recorded results. This work has recently finished so it is proposed to monitor the situation to see if the levels now drop to the levels recorded prior to the work commencing.</p>\n<p>There have been road works near to the AQMS on Kings Road for a significant part of the year due to junction and bus lane improvements. This may have impacted the results recorded in 2014. These have now been completed so it is proposed to monitor the situation to see if levels now drop back to levels records in previous years.</p>\n<h2>What are the key inequalities?</h2>\n<p>People with respiratory or pulmonary conditions are more susceptible to poor air quality</p>\n<h2>What are the unmet needs/ service gaps?</h2>\n<p>There have been no new local sources or substantial changes to existing sources that have been identified as having a significant impact on air quality between 2012 and 2015. It is proposed to continue to monitor the situation.</p>\n<h2>This section links to the following sections in the JSNA:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/obesity-adult-and-child/\">Obesity &#8211; adult &amp; child</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/diabetes/\">Diabetes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/cardiovascular-disease/\">Cardiovascular Disease</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/council/archive-jsna-profiles/respiratory/\">Respiratory</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Committee on The Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (2010).

This Code is adopted, pursuant to Section 27(2) of the Localism Act 2011, to give force to the Council&#8217;s statutory duty, under Section 27(1) of the Act, to promote and maintain high standards of Conduct by Councillors and co-opted members of the authority.</p>\n<p>2. This Code is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the obligations placed on Councillors and co-opted members of this authority. It is your responsibility to comply with the following provisions of this Code as well as other legal obligations beyond the scope of this Code.</p>\n<p>3. It shall be a defence to an allegation that you have failed to comply with the Code if you can demonstrate that your conduct was reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>\n<p>4. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p>4.1 This Code is based on and consistent with the following seven Principles which are set out in Section 28 of the Localism Act 2011, and which were originally set out by the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life:</p>\n<h3>Selflessness</h3>\n<p>Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits.</p>\n<h3>Integrity</h3>\n<p>Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties.</p>\n<h3>Objectivity</h3>\n<p>In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit.</p>\n<h3>Accountability</h3>\n<p>Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.</p>\n<h3>Openness</h3>\n<p>Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.</p>\n<h3>Honesty</h3>\n<p>Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest.</p>\n<h3>Leadership</h3>\n<p>Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example.</p>\n<p>4.2 In following these principles, you must be aware of the laws that confer special obligations on Councillors and co-opted Members, as set out in Appendix 1.</p>\n<p>4.3 You should also follow the guidance for compliance with the General Principles and the Code of Conduct, as set out in Appendix 2.</p>\n<p>5.

However, you are actively encouraged to register and declare any non- financial interests held by you or your spouse or partner, in the interests of transparency and to avoid allegations of personal bias.</p>\n<p>7.3.2 In particular you are actively encouraged to register the following interests:</p>\n<p>(a) membership, or holding a position of general control or management, of a body or bodies to which you have been appointed or nominated by the authority<br />\n(b) membership or holding a position of general control or management of any body that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>exercises functions of a public nature</li>\n<li>is directed to charitable purposes</li>\n<li>one of whose principle purposes includes the influence of public opinion or policy (including any political party or trades union)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(c) any body or person from whom you have received a gift or hospitality with an estimated value of at least £25.</p>\n<p>7.4 Declaration of Interests at Meetings</p>\n<p>7.4.1 You should declare any interest that you and/or your spouse or partner hold, under 7.1 and 7.3 above, which relates to or is likely to affect an item of Council business being transacted at any meeting of the authority at which you are present.</p>\n<p>7.4.2 In the interests of transparency, openness and the avoidance of bias, you should also declare any pecuniary interest, under 7.1 above, which relates to or is likely to affect an item of Council business being transacted at any meeting of the authority at which you are present, that is held by a member of your family or the family of your spouse or partner, or by a person with whom you or your spouse or partner have a close association.</p>\n<p>7.4.3 Under Section 31(4) of the Localism Act 2011, any Members who are aware that they have a disclosable prejudicial interest in an item of business being considered at a meeting at which they are present may not participate in the discussion, or vote, on the item of business at the meeting.</p>\n<p>7.4.4 If you declare that you have a pecuniary interest which relates to or is likely to affect an item of Council business being transacted at a meeting of the authority at which you are present, you may make representations, answer questions and give evidence on the item of business, subject to there being equivalent public speaking rights, but you may not participate in the discussion or vote on the item of business, and you should leave the meeting before any discussion on the item of business takes place at the meeting and before the vote on the item of business is taken.</p>\n<p>7.4.5 You should declare the interest as soon as you become aware of it at the meeting. Each public meeting will have a &#8220;Declaration of Interests&#8221; item at the start of its agenda.</p>\n<p>7.4.6 You should declare both the existence of an interest, and details of the interest. All declared interests will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.</p>\n<p>7.4.7 If you realise that you, and/or your spouse/partner, have a disclosable pecuniary interest in an item of business at a meeting which you have not previously registered, then you must both declare the interest at the meeting and then give written notice to the Monitoring Officer, within 28 days of the meting, of the existence and nature of the interest, for inclusion in the authority&#8217;s published register.</p>\n<p>7.5 Declaration of Interests by Single Members</p>\n<p>7.5.1 Members who, by virtue of any office that they hold on behalf of the authority, are in a position to take decisions on behalf of the authority, are bound by the same requirements as in 7.4 above, and in this respect you should:</p>\n<p>(a) Make a public declaration of any interest that you, and/or your spouse or partner, have in any item of business of the authority that they are considering; and<br />\n(b) Not consider or take a decision on any item of business in which you, and/or your spouse/partner, have a disclosable pecuniary interest.</p>\n<p>7.6 Sensitive Interests</p>\n<p>7.6.1 This applies to a situation where a Member considers that the disclosure of the details of your interest &#8211; including that of your spouse or partner &#8211; could lead to you, or a person connected with you, being subject to violence or intimidation.</p>\n<p>7.6.2 In such circumstances you should share your concerns with the authority&#8217;s Monitoring Officer. If the Monitoring Officer agrees with you, s/he will not include details of the interest in the authority&#8217;s Register of Interests, but may state that you had registered an interest the details of which had been withheld under Section 32(2) of the Localism Act 2011.</p>\n<p>7.6.3 Similarly, if the Monitoring Officer has accepted that you have a sensitive interest under Section 32 of the Localism Act 2011, you should declare the existence of the interest at any meeting at which you are present but you need not declare the details of the interest.</p>\n<p>7.7 Dispensations</p>\n<p>7.7.1 The authority may grant a dispensation to Members who have a disclosable pecuniary interest in an item of business being conducted at a meeting of the authority at which they are present, to allow them to participate in the discussion and vote on the item of business.</p>\n<p>7.7.2 In such cases, you must make a written request for a dispensation to the Monitoring Officer, who will put the request before the Standards Committee. Under Section 33(2) of the Localism Act 2011, a dispensation may only be granted where the Monitoring Officer and the Committee consider, having had regard to all relevant circumstances, that:</p>\n<p>(a) without the dispensation the number of persons prohibited from taking part in the item of business would be so great a proportion of the meeting as to impede the transaction of the business<br />\n(b) without the dispensation the representation of different political groups at the meeting would be so upset as to alter the likely outcome of any vote relating to the item of business<br />\n(c) granting the dispensation is in the interests of persons living in the authority&#8217;s area<br />\n(d) each member of the authority&#8217;s executive would be prohibited from participating in any particular business to be transacted by the authority&#8217;s executive</p>\n<p>7.7.3 The Standards Committee will grant a dispensation for a specified period of time, which may not exceed four years.</p>\n<p>7.8 Sanctions</p>\n<p>7.8.1 Under Section 34 of the Localism Act 2011 Members will be committing an offence if you:</p>\n<p>(a) fail, without reasonable excuse, to register or declare a disclosable pecuniary interest (7.1)<br />\n(b) participate in any discussion or vote on an item of business in which you have such an interest (7.4)<br />\n(c) register or declare false or misleading information, or are reckless as to whether the information is true or misleading</p>\n<p>7.8.2 Such offences will be heard in court, on a prosecution initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The penalties available to the court are:</p>\n<p>(a) a fine of up to £5,000<br />\n(b) disqualification from being a Member of the authority, or any other authority, for up to 5 years</p>\n<p>7.9 Registration of Gifts and Hospitality</p>\n<p>7.9.1 If you receive any gift or hospitality over the value of £25 in your role as a Member of the authority, you must provide written notification to the Monitoring Officer within 28 days of the existence and nature of that gift or hospitality. The Monitoring Officer will record this in a gift book, and will publish details of all gifts and hospitality registered by Members each year to the Council&#8217;s Standards Committee.</p>\n<h2>Laws conferring special obligations on Councillors and co-opted Members</h2>\n<p>Bribery Act 2010<br />\nLocalism Act 2011<br />\nData Protection Act 1998<br />\nFreedom of Information Act 2000<br />\nEmployment Rights Act 1996<br />\nLocal Government Act 1972</p>\n<p>Equality enactments including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Equal Pay Act 1970 (c. 41),</li>\n<li>the Sex Discrimination Act 1975,</li>\n<li>the Race Relations Act 1976,</li>\n<li>the Disability Discrimination Act 1995,</li>\n<li>the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003</li>\n<li>the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003</li>\n<li>the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006</li>\n<li>the Equality Act 2006 and regulations made under this Act</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Guidance on Compliance with the General Principles</h2>\n<p>1.

People from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities tend to have poorer mental health and have more difficulty in accessing mental health care than the majority of the population.

In granting DRR we will<br />\nconsider the sustainability of the organisation.</p>\n<p>DRR will only be granted if there is a risk that the organisation will become<br />\nunviable, and that the granting of DRR in the short term will make the<br />\norganisation sustainable for a reasonable period in the future.</p>\n<p>There are a number of exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early Years Providers will be considered for DRR as part of a funding formula that targets children and families in greatest need. Both privately owned and voluntary managed Early Years providers will be eligible. Please contact the Early Years and Play Services on 0118 937 37 37</li>\n<li>Voluntary, not for profit and private sector providers that are currently commissioned to provide services on behalf of Reading Borough Council will not generally be considered for DRR as they should already have demonstrated that they are financially viable at the start of the arrangement. These organisations would have to demonstrate that their circumstances have substantially changed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HOW TO APPLY<br />\nApplication forms are available and should be returned by 15th June<br />\n2016 for DRR between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applicants will be informed of the outcome by 13th July 2016 and<br />\nif successful DRR will be backdated to 1 April 2016.</li>\n<li>Applicants should continue to pay rates until a decision is made.

    "content": "<ol>\n<li>INTRODUCTION</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.1 Reading is the County Town of Berkshire. It is currently the third most diverse and one of the most cosmopolitan and dynamic communities in the South East. It lies at the heart of the Thames Valley, and is widely regarded as the &#8216;Silicon Valley&#8217; of the UK. Over the last 10 years, Reading has also benefited from being one of the fastest growing and sustained economies in the country. Whilst the recent economic downturn had an impact, the effect was to a lesser degree than in some areas of the country. It is still home to 13 of the world&#8217;s top 30 global brands, with the likes of Prudential, Microsoft and Oracle all based locally.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.2 Whilst the borough of Reading covers some 4030 hectares and is also home to around 145,000 residents, the wider urban area has a population of around 275,000 with an even broader retail &#8216;catchment area&#8217; of over 1.2 This is a significant aspect of the Reading of today: a sub-regional capital attracting large numbers of workers, shoppers and visitors from a wide area, adding to its vitality and success. Over 13% of the population is made up from minority ethnic communities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.3 Reading has a University, which during term time, further increase the residential population by around 17,500 and a College of Further Education which increases the population during term time by a further 8,500, many of whom again contribute to Reading&#8217;s economy.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.4 The ongoing regeneration of the town centre and the arrival of The Oracle shopping centre, originally lifted Reading into the top ten retail destinations in the UK, and it has maintained this position until very recently. However, it is currently rated at 16 on most recent research.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.5 One of the reasons that town centres like Reading are attractive to the public, is that they are areas offering an attractive, safe and vehicle-free environment with a wide variety of retail, food leisure and services on offer. The public are drawn to such areas because they know that they will have a pleasant and satisfying social experience that goes beyond just commercial activity. This is borne out by the quality and quantity of the businesses that pay significant amounts of non-domestic rates and a Business Improvement District levy to maintain and where possible improve that standard.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.6 The Oracle is a large privately owned shopping complex to the south of the area. Because it is private, the quality of the pedestrian and leisure experience can be said to be the most appealing in the town centre. When it originally opened, there were a number of large nightclub venues. However, recent years has seen a shift in the type of venue available, with a greater influence towards family entertainment, restaurants and specialised markets.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.7 Whilst Reading is the largest and the County town in Berkshire, there are many other towns of substantial size, including from the east to west, Slough, Windsor, Maidenhead, Bracknell, Wokingham and Newbury, many residents of which regularly visit Reading for retail and social activities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.8 Reading&#8217;s vision for the shaping of its future has been carefully considered by seeking views from its residents, local businesses and all its partners, in order to ensure a thriving and balanced environment with a sustainable economy. Social premises should be varied so as to provide diversity and choice. They should be attractive and accessible to all.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.9 The intention of the local authority is to create a well-balanced mix of alcohol and entertainment venues, thereby catering for the widest possible cultural and ethnic diversity.</p>\n<p>2. THE PRESENT</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.1 The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1982 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;) introduced a licensing scheme to control sex establishments, that is to say, sex shops and sex cinemas.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.2 Section 27 of the Policing and crime Act 2009 amends Schedule 3 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) 1982. It introduces the new concept of &#8220;Sexual Entertainment Venue&#8221; and allows the Licensing Authority to licence such venues, where &#8220;relevant entertainment&#8221; is provided;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(a) before a live audience; and</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(b) for the financial gain of the organiser or the entertainer.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.3 Relevant entertainment means, &#8220;any live performance or any live display of nudity&#8221;, provided solely or principally for the purpose of stimulating any member of the audience.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.4 Reading Borough Council has adopted the Act, and at present, there are two sex shops in the borough. One is located on Southampton Street, and one is located on Oxford Road. At present there are no licensed Sexual Entertainment Venues; however there is one premise that operates as a lap dancing club, which is located in the town centre on St Mary Butts. This premise will require a Sex Establishment Licence under the change made to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 in 2010.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.5 A number of establishments that hold events, which involve full or partial nudity less frequently than once a month, may not require a Sex Establishment licence or may be except from the requirements to obtain a Sex Establishment Applicants are advised to contact the local authority for details.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.6 The Act imposes a duty on a local authority to refuse a licence by reference to, amongst other things, the criminal convictions of applicants. It also empowers a local authority to refuse to grant or renew a licence by reference to the number of Sex Establishments, which the local authority considers appropriate for the locality of the premises, subject of the application and the character of the locality.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.7 This document outlines a policy, which will guide the Council when considering applications for licences, bearing in mind the spirit and intent of the Act and case law decided since it was passed. The Council shall not follow this policy inflexibly but shall take all relevant factors into consideration in determining an application. Each case shall be decided on its merits.</p>\n<p>3. APPLICANTS</p>\n<p>Individuals, limited companies and firms may apply for licences.</p>\n<p>4. DURATION OF LICENCES</p>\n<p>Licences are generally issued on an annual basis but can be issued for a shorter term if deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p>5. CRIME AND DISORDER</p>\n<p>Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, local authorities must have regard to the likely effect of the exercise of their functions, and do all that they can to prevent, crime and disorder in their area. This policy will have regard to the likely impact of such licences on related crime and disorder in the borough.</p>\n<p>6. HUMAN RIGHTS</p>\n<p>The Human Rights Act 1998, incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights, and makes it unlawful for a local authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. The Council will have particular regard to the following relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights: &#8211;</p>\n<p>(i) Article 6, in relation to the determination of civil rights and obligations, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time, by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law;</p>\n<p>(ii) Article 8, in that everyone has the right to respect for his home and private life, including, for example, the right to a &#8220;good night sleep&#8221;;</p>\n<p>(iii) Article 1 of the first protocol, that every person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his or her possessions. It should be noted that the Courts have held that a licence is a person&#8217;s possession.</p>\n<p>7. DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">7.1 The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, introduced measures to tackle discrimination encountered by disabled people in the areas of employment, access to goods, facilities and services and the management, buying or renting of land or property. For service providers, such as licensees: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) with effect from December 1996, it has been unlawful to treat disabled people less favourably than other people for a reason related to their disability;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(ii) with effect from October 1999, they have had to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, such as providing extra help to make changes to the way they provide their services;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(iii) with effect from 2004, they have had to make reasonable adjustments to the physical features of the premises to overcome physical barriers to access.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">7.2 This policy will have regard to the likely impact of licensing of sex establishment on disability discrimination particularly when considering the operation and management of the premises.</p>\n<p>8. IMPACT</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">8.1 In considering applications for the grant of new licences or variation of conditions, the Council will assess the likelihood of a grant causing adverse impacts, particularly on local residents. The Council will take the following general matters into account: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) type of activity;<br />(ii) duration of proposed licence;<br />(iii) proposed hours of operation;<br />(iv) layout and condition of the premises;<br />(v) the use to which premises in the vicinity are put;<br />(vi) the character of the locality in which the premises are situated.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">8.2 In considering all applications for the grant of new licences or applications for variation of conditions the Council will take into account the potential impacts of the licensed activity on:-</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) crime and disorder;<br />(ii) cumulative impact of licensed premises in the area, including hours of operation;<br />(iii) the character of the locality in which the premises is situated;<br />(iv) public Safety;<br />(v) prevention of Public Nuisance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">8.3 Where an application is made to renew a licence for the same activity, hours of operation and conditions as previously licensed the Council shall give due weight to the fact that the licence was granted in the previous year and for a number of years before that as appropriate. However, the Council will take into account: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) levels of recorded crime and disorder in area;<br />(ii) evidence of past demonstrable adverse impacts from the activity on the safety and amenity of local residents;<br />(iii) whether appropriate measures have been agreed and put into effect by the applicant to mitigate any adverse impacts.</p>\n<p>9. LOCATION</p>\n<p>9.1 Licences will only be granted in predominately commercial areas and the Council is mindful of its power to determine that no sex establishment should be located in a particular locality. In accordance with case law, the Council shall decide a locality as a matter of fact to be determined by the particular circumstances of each case and not by drawing boundaries on a map. The table below is not exhaustive and we would consider representations from applicants as to why our view should be changed about a particular locality.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><th>Locality</th><th>Number of sex entertainment venues</th><th>Reason</th></tr><tr><td>Reading town centre (appendix I)</td><td>Two</td><td>Varied night time economy, entertainment area, SEV, would be appropriate in this area.</td></tr><tr><td>Caversham (North of the Thames)</td><td>None</td><td>The whole area is mainly residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Portman Road Industrial Estate</td><td>One</td><td>Very limited residential properties mainly small industrial units</td></tr><tr><td>Wensley Road,<br>Southcote Road</td><td>None</td><td>These areas are residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Whitley Wood residential areas</td><td>None</td><td>The whole are is residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Craddock Road and Acre Road Industrial areas</td><td>One</td><td>Very limited residential properties mainly mixed industrial</td></tr><tr><td>South East Reading (eg Orts Road, Kendrick Road and Palmer Park area)</td><td>None</td><td>The whole are is residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Tilehurse area (eg Tilehurst Road, Oxford Road, Norcot Road, School Road)</td><td>None</td><td> The whole are is residential, with limited commercial or retail areas </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n<p>10. FITNESS OF APPLICANT POLICIES</p>\n<p>An applicant must be a fit and proper person to hold a licence. In determining suitability for a new licence or a transfer the Council will in most case take into account:-</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(i) previous knowledge and experience of the applicant;<br />(ii) any evidence of the operation of any existing or previous licence held by the applicant, including any licence held in any other borough;<br />(iii) and any report about the applicant and management of the premises received from statutory objectors.</p>\n<p>11. SUITABILITY POLICY</p>\n<p>All licensees are required to ensure that the premises: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(i) comply with all health and safety law;<br />(ii) are not a source of nuisance to residents in the vicinity.</p>\n<p>12. PROPOSED OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT POLICIES</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.1 The Council requires all licensees to ensure that they and their employees comply with all relevant licence conditions and health and safety regulations.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.2 In terms of management of licensed premises, the Council strongly encourages where possible and appropriate, will require that licensees:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) work with statutory agencies such as the Police, and the Council in order to create and maintain a safe environment; both within licensed premises and in the environs around them;<br />(ii) particularly those whose premises are located in areas with the highest levels of recorded crime, develop crime prevention strategies in consultation with the Police and the council.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.3 In terms of the management of licensed premises, the Council strongly encourages and where possible and appropriate will require all licensees to develop strategies and procedures to increase access for disabled people to the premises.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.4 In terms of the employment of staff in licensed premises, the Council requires that all relevant staff be appropriately trained in areas such as health and safety, first aid, and fire precautions.</p>\n<p>13. PUBLIC CONSULTATION</p>\n<p>The Council will normally consult local residents in relations to applications for grant, renewal or variation of the terms or conditions of a licence. The nature and extent of consultation will depend on the history of a particular premises and the perceived likelihood of problems occurring and objections being received.</p>\n<p>14. LEGAL CONSULTATIONS</p>\n<p>Applicants are required to give public notice of the application by publishing an advertisement in a local newspaper circulating in the area where the premises are situated and to display a similar notice on or near the premises for 21 days beginning with the date of the application.</p>\n<p>15. CONSULTATION WITH STATUTORY AGENCIES AND OTHER ORGANISATION</p>\n<p>In most cases the Council will consult with all relevant services within the Council and the Fire Authority to ensure that all relevant information is available when considering an application.</p>\n<p>(Planning see item 1)</p>\n<p>16. CONSULTATION WITH WARD COUNCILLORS</p>\n<p>Relevant Ward Councillors will be notified in writing of all applications for grant, renewals and transfer of licences and the variation of conditions within their Ward, and also those on or near the Ward boundary.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">16.1 In considering any application for the grant, renewal or transfer of a licence the Council is also obliged to have regard to any observations submitted by the Chief Constable of police and any objections received from members of the public in response to public advertisement of the application.</p>\n<p>17. OTHER POLICIES</p>\n<p>The Council may identify and apply other requirements from time to time, subject to consultation and proper notice.</p>\n<p>18. PLANNING</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.1 The Authority recognises that licensing applications should not be seen as a re-run of the planning application process and that there should be a clear separation of the planning and licensing regimes to avoid duplication and inefficiency. However, the Authority will normally expect applicants to demonstrate that, their proposed use of the premises is lawful in planning  terms,  including  complying with any conditions that may be imposed upon a planning consent, prior to applications under this Act being submitted. Nevertheless, the Council recognises that it is legally permissible for applications for licences to be made before any relevant planning permission has been sought or granted by the planning authority.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.2 As outlined at paragraph 13.67 of the Consolidated Guidance issued under Section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003 (March 2010 version), there are also circumstances when as a condition of planning permission; a terminal hour has been set for the use of premises for commercial purposes. Where these hours are different to the licensing hours, the applicant MUST observe the earlier closing time. Premises operating in breach of their planning permission would be liable to prosecution under planning law.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.3 Where a licence application is to be determined by the Licensing Applications Sub Committee, the Sub Committee in such cases will normally impose a condition to the effect that the licence will not become effective, until the relevant planning consent has been obtained.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.4 Reading Borough Council is preparing its Local Development Framework. To date, it has adopted two documents and is working on a further document. The planning policy framework also currently relies on a number of saved policies from the Reading Borough Local Plan that was adopted in 1998.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.5 The Local Development Framework consists of a number of documents, which are reviewed and modified to take account of ever changing demands. Currently these are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(a) Core Strategy (adopted Jan 2008) &#8211; sets out the spatial vision and strategic objectives, a spatial strategy and core policies related to the implementation of the strategy. </p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(b) Reading Central Area Action Plan (Adopted Jan 2009) &#8211; policies and proposals for the central area of Reading.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(c) Sites and Detailed Policies Document &#8211; a pre-submission draft was published for consultation during February 2010. It is likely that further consultation will be undertaken early in 2011 and the programme envisages adoption of the document towards the end of 2011/early 2012. This document includes specific site allocations for the Borough outside the Central Area and detailed policies to be used for determining planning applications.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.6 Until the Sites and Detailed Policies Document is adopted, various policies in the Reading Borough Local Plan have been saved and will remain part of the development plan. (See web link below). These include the following policies that are relevant to licensed premises:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RET 3A: District and Major Local Shopping Centres (LP)</li>\n<li>RET 3B: Other Local Shopping Centres (LP)</li>\n<li>RET 5: Retail and Catering Users in Residential Areas (LP)</li>\n<li>RET 7: Petrol Filling Stations and Other Vehicle Related Uses (LP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.7 These main Local Development Documents (LDD&#8217;s) are used in conjunction with national planning policy statements. Also, at the local level, there are a number of site-specific developments, briefs and supplementary planning and guidance documents, which are relevant to various parts of the borough.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.8 The LDD&#8217;s will seek to strengthen existing district and local centres. Whilst no definitive extensions to these centres have been agreed from a planning perspective, licensed premises in these areas will play an important role as part of this objective and within the role of the 24-hour economy in Planning permission for A3 (or similar) uses are therefore likely to be restricted within these areas rather than within other predominantly residential areas.</p>\n<p>18.9 The Reading Central Area Action Plan identifies in more detail issues relating to licensed premises, the 24-hour economy and the general organisation of retailing within the town</p>\n<p>18.10 The key issues surrounding the determination of planning permission for A3 type uses are likely to remain as follows:</p>\n<p>(a) Impact on residential amenity through noise, odour, disturbance, litter, etc.<br />(b) Impact on the viability of the Town Centre, defined district and local centres including the need to maintain reasonable levels of retail (A1) uses.<br />(c) Potential S106 contributions towards CCTV and City Safe<br />(d) Each planning application will continue to be considered on its own merits.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

We thank you in advance for your consideration.</p>\n<p>The regulations in the following pages have been drawn up by Reading Borough Council to ensure that the Cemeteries and Gardens of Remembrance are managed and used in a sensitive and appropriate way for everybody. These are communal spaces for quiet reflection and<br />\nremembering our loved ones.</p>\n<p>Although these regulations are a requirement for the management of the Cemeteries and Gardens, every effort has been made to avoid restricting the rights and choices of the individual. Therefore, these regulations have been prepared with a balance between individual rights/information and the need to regulate for safe and tidy grounds. For example, the restrictions on glass are based upon these items becoming potential hazards when mowers are used. It is not based upon aesthetic considerations.</p>\n<p>The Council has adopted the principles of the Charter for the Bereaved and is committed to giving the individual the rights that are provided by the Charter. For further information contact the Cemetery Office or see the “Information” section of the Institute for Cemetery and Crematorium Management (ICCM) website, <a href=\"http://www.iccm-uk.com/iccm/\">http://www.iccm-uk.com/iccm/</a></p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council under the Local Authorities’ Cemeteries Order 1977 is responsible for regulating three Cemeteries in the town. It is required by that Order to set out regulations to provide a safe and dignified environment for all visitors and can do anything considered necessary for the proper management of these Cemeteries. The cemeteries for which the<br />\nCouncil is responsible under these regulations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Henley Road Cemetery, All Hallows Road, Caversham.</li>\n<li>Reading Cemetery, London Road, Reading.</li>\n<li>Caversham Cemetery, Victoria Road, Caversham.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The office for all three Cemeteries is located just inside the main entrance gates at Henley Road Cemetery.

Within these clearly defined areas it is permitted to plant seasonal flowers, put personal items of memorabilia or unwrapped fresh cut flowers.</p>\n<p>All items of memorabilia must be below 12 inches (300mm) in height.</p>\n<h2>Appendix 2: Framework for enforcement of Rules &amp; Regulations</h2>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>In 2011, following numerous complaints about memorabilia and the upkeep of the grounds, it became evident that clearer regulations with a transparent enforcement framework were necessary. The Council consulted widely with residents, memorial owners, families of the bereaved and other stakeholders about amending the Rules and Regulations that apply to Reading Cemeteries and Crematorium. Revisions were made to support the implementation of the Charter for the Bereaved by offering more choice, whilst giving the Service the regulatory framework necessary to ensure a safe and dignified environment for all visitors, which is sympathetic to the landscape.</p>\n<p>The amended Rules and Regulations were approved by council’s Cabinet on 11 July 2011. This Enforcement Framework was approved at the same time to form part of the Rules and Regulations as an Appendix. It makes clear how the Council intends to deal with any infringement of the Regulations and how this will be communicated to the persons concerned.<br />\nThe Council recognises the importance of memorials to families after a bereavement and therefore any action to enforce Regulations will be taken in a sensitive and measured way.</p>\n<h3>Principles behind Enforcement Framework</h3>\n<p>The underlying principles behind the Enforcement Framework are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to ensure equal treatment for all;</li>\n<li>to ensure it is clear to everyone what will happen if Regulations are infringed;</li>\n<li>to ensure a safe and dignified environment for all visitors.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Enforcement Framework</h3>\n<p>The Bereavement Services Manager will</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prioritise areas of the grounds where the most infringements of Regulations are taking place.</li>\n<li>Put up public notices in the area to be addressed.</li>\n<li>Put up public notices on the notice boards nearest the area to be addressed and at the Crematorium office.</li>\n<li>Public notices will specify the following:\n<ul>\n<li>a. Precisely what area is to be addressed</li>\n<li>b. Date the notice is put up</li>\n<li>c. Date the notice period ends</li>\n<li>d. Defined memorial area where personal items may be placed</li>\n<li>e. Items that are not allowed</li>\n<li>f. What will happen to any items infringing the Regulations</li>\n<li>g. How to contact the Service Manager</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A notice period of 6 weeks will be specified.</li>\n<li>Where records are available and considered to be in date, letters will be sent to all memorial owners in the area to be addressed, clearly stating that any items infringing Rules &amp; Regulations need to be removed within the 6 week notice period. Information included will be identical to that on the public notices.</li>\n<li>After the specified time period has expired any remaining items that infringe regulations will be removed with the utmost care and sensitivity.</li>\n<li>Where possible removed items will be put in individual labelled bags and stored for 12 months.</li>\n<li>After 12 months, any individual labelled bags of items not collected will be disposed of.</li>\n<li>Any plants, trees or shrubs will be labelled and retained for collection where possible.</li>\n<li>When it is not possible to remove any plant, tree or shrub without damaging it, it will be disposed of with other green waste at the cemetery.</li>\n<li>Any memorial owner with concerns should address these to the Bereavement Services Manager who will give them his considered attention.</li>\n<li>If a memorial owner wishes to make a formal complaint about the removal of personal items, this will be dealt with through the council’s complaint procedure.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "content": "<h2>The Art of a Good Marriage</h2>\n<p>A Good marriage must be created.<br />\nIn marriage the little things are the big things&#8230;.<br />\nIt is never being too old to hold hands.,<br />\nIt is remembering to say &#8220;I love you&#8221; at least once a day.<br />\nIt is never going to sleep angry.<br />\nIt is having a mutual sense of values and common objectives.<br />\nIt is standing together and facing the world.<br />\nIt is forming a circle of love that gathers in the whole family.<br />\nIt is speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating gratitude in thoughtful ways.<br />\nIt is having the capacity to forgive and forget.<br />\nIt is giving each other an atmosphere in which each can grow.<br />\nIt is a common search for the good and the beautiful.<br />\nIt is not only marrying the right person, it is being the right partner.</p>\n<h2>The Most Wonderful Of All Things In Life</h2>\n<p>The most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom one&#8217;s relationship has a growing depth, beauty and joy as the years increase. This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvellous thing; it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it. It is a sort of divine accident, and the most wonderful of all things in life.</p>\n<h2>What is Love</h2>\n<p>Sooner or later we begin to understand that love is more than verse on valentines and romance in the movies. We begin to know that love is here and now, real and true, the most important thing in our lives. For love is the creator of our favourite memories and the foundation of our fondest dreams. Love is a<br />\npromise that is always kept, a fortune that can never be spent, a seed that can flourish in even the most unlikely of places. And this radiance that never fades,<br />\nthis mysterious and magical joy, is the greatest treasure of all &#8211; one known only by those who love.</p>\n<h2>Marriage is a Commitment to Life</h2>\n<p>Marriage is a commitment to life, the best that two people can find and bring out in each other. It offers opportunities for sharing and growth that no other<br />\nrelationship can equal. It is a physical and an emotional joining that is promised for a lifetime. Within the circle of its love, marriage encompasses all of life&#8217;s most important relationships. A wife and a husband are each other&#8217;s best friend, confidant, lover, teacher, listener and critic. And there may come times when one partner is heartbroken or ailing and the love of the other may resemble the tender caring of a parent for a child.</p>\n<p>Marriage deepens and enriches every facet of life. Happiness is fuller, memories are fresher, commitment is stronger, even anger is felt more strongly, and passes away more quickly. Marriage understands and forgives the mistakes life is unable to avoid. It encourages and nurtures new life, new experiences and new ways of expressing a love that is deeper than life.</p>\n<p>When two people pledge their love and care for each other in marriage they create a spirit unique unto themselves which binds them closer than any spoken<br />\nor written words. Marriage is a promise, a potential made in the hearts of two people who love each other and takes a lifetime to fulfil.</p>\n<h2>Captain Corelli&#8217;s Mandolin</h2>\n<p>Love is a temporary madness; it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides.<br />\nAnd when it subsides, you have to make a decision.<br />\nYou have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is.</p>\n<p>Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of<br />\nthe day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don&#8217;t blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being &#8220;in love&#8221;, which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.</p>\n<h2>Guide for a Loving Home</h2>\n<p>May we treat one another with respect, honesty and care. May we share the little discoveries and changes each day brings. May we try always to be sensitive to one another&#8217;s joys, sorrows, needs and changing moods, and realise that being a loving family means sometimes not understanding everyone all the time, but being there to love and help them just the same.</p>\n<h2>From Mark Twain</h2>\n<p>A marriage&#8230;&#8230; Makes of two fractional lives a whole; it gives two purposeless lives a work, and doubles the strength of each to perform it; it gives to two<br />\nquestioning natures a reason for living, and something to live for; it will give a new gladness to the sunshine, a new fragrance to the flowers, a new beauty to the earth, and a new mystery to life.</p>\n<h2>Marriage</h2>\n<p>Marriage is a dynamic process of discovery.<br />\nMarriage is a journey not an arrival.<br />\nIn marriage, being the right person is as important as finding the right person.<br />\nMarriage is starting to love, over and over again.<br />\nMarriage is a life&#8217;s work.<br />\nMarriage is an art&#8230; and like any creative process, it requires active thought and effort.<br />\nIn marriage there is a need to learn how to share on many different levels.<br />\nIn marriage there is a need to practise talking from the heart, and understanding attitudes as well as words.<br />\nGiving generously and receiving graciously are talents that are available to anyone.<br />\nBut all these skills need to be developed, if the marriage picture that we paint is to be anything approaching the masterpiece intended.</p>\n<h2>Extract from &#8216;Portrait of a Marriage&#8217; (Nigel Nicolson)</h2>\n<p>Marriage was they thought, only tolerable for people of strong character and independent minds if it were regarded as a lifetime association between intimate friends. And as a happy marriage is &#8216;the greatest of human benefits&#8217;, husband and wife must strive hard for its success. Each must be subtle enough to mould their characters and behaviour to fit the other&#8217;s, facet to facet, convex to concave. The husband must develop the feminine side of his nature, the wife her<br />\nmasculine side. He must cultivate the qualities of sympathy and intuition; she those of detachment, reason and decision. He must respond to tears; she must not miss trains&#8230;.</p>\n<h2>From Sir Philip Sidney</h2>\n<p>My true love hath my heart, and I have his,<br />\nBy just exchange one for another given.<br />\nI hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss:<br />\nThere never was a better bargain driven.<br />\nMy true love hath my heart and I have his.<br />\nHis heart in me, keeps him and me in one,<br />\nMy heart in him, his thoughts and senses guides:<br />\nHe loves my heart, for once it was his own:<br />\nI cherish his, because in me it bides.<br />\nMy true love hath my heart and I have his.</p>\n<h2>Three Short Readings (Unknown Writers)</h2>\n<p>1. Throughout your marriage always remember that the spectrum of love has nine ingredients: Patience, Kindness, Generosity, Humility, Courtesy, Unselfishness, Good Temper, Guilelessness and Sincerity. Thus will your love today survive throughout your married life.</p>\n<p>2. On your wedding day and every day thereafter May your home be filled with happiness and your hearts with love and laughter And may each year together find you more and more in love and bring you all the happiness you&#8217;re so deserving of. May the joy of true companionship be yours to share through life,<br />\nand may you treasure always the day you became husband and wife.</p>\n<p>3. Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be a shelter for the other. Now you will feel no cold, for each of you will be warmth to the other. Now there is<br />\nno more loneliness. Now you are two persons, but there is only one life before you. Go now to your dwelling to enter into the days of your life together. And may your days be good and long upon the earth.</p>\n<h2>How to Stay Together One More Day!</h2>\n<p>Laugh at yourself and at each other. Practice unselfishness. Show your love. Talk to not at, each other. Respond lovingly to his or her request. Greet and leave each other with kind words. Criticise the action, not the person. Hold hands. Resolve the day&#8217;s differences before bedtime. Admit your failings and ask for forgiveness. Don&#8217;t fight dirty. Enjoy the present and welcome the future. Make love, not waves.</p>\n<h2>From Deanne Laura Gilbert</h2>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means that I accept you for the person that you are, and that I don&#8217;t wish to change you into someone else. It means that I do not expect perfection from you, just as you don&#8217;t expect it from me.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means that I will love you and stand by you even through the worst of times. It means loving you when you are in a bad mood or too tired to do the things I want to do. It means loving you when you are down, not just when you&#8217;re fun to be with.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means that I know your deepest secrets and do not judge you for them, asking in return only that you do not judge me for mine. It means that I<br />\ncare enough not to let you go. It means thinking of you, dreaming of you, wanting and needing you constantly, and hoping you feel the same way for me.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means forever.</p>\n<h2>Love as we know It</h2>\n<p>Love, it can be said, has many guises.<br />\nIt will shine in a Mother&#8217;s smile,<br />\nAnd be hidden in a Father&#8217;s warm embrace &#8211;<br />\nOr felt in a child&#8217;s velvet kisses.<br />\nLove may even hide in sibling squabbles.<br />\nLove is presented by Lovers in little unexpected gifts.<br />\nIt is pronounced to the world by hand-holding elderly couples.<br />\nAnd found in listening to a friend&#8217;s tears in the wee small hours.<br />\nLove is enduring and unjudging.<br />\nIt is safety and sanctuary from a world of vexation.<br />\nLove, when nurtured, grows and blossoms like honeysuckle &#8211;<br />\nSpreading and encompassing all within its reach.<br />\nLove has an incalculable value, far beyond worldly currency,<br />\nFor it cannot be bought or sold.<br />\nThat Love, which isn&#8217;t given freely, is not Love at all.<br />\nLove joins together, but does not create constraints or shackle &#8211;<br />\nRather it is a safe mooring, from which each may journey and return,<br />\nAssured of a warm homecoming.<br />\nNow may each of you be more acutely aware<br />\nOf that Love which your heart gives and receives<br />\nFor such treasure should be highly prized.</p>\n<h2>The Mathematics of Love</h2>\n<p>From today may your joys be added,<br />\nYour cares subtracted,<br />\nYour worries divided<br />\nAnd your love multiplied!<br />\nThere is no greater happiness than that of sharing life,<br />\nSharing all its joys and cares as a loving man and wife.<br />\nAnd since you&#8217;ve found that happiness, what more is there to say,<br />\nExcept to hope your joys will grow still sweeter day by day.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms (Sophie Hannah)</h2>\n<p>Although you have given me a stomach upset,<br />\nWeak knees, a lurching heart, a fuzzy brain,<br />\nA high-pitched laugh, a monumental phone bill,<br />\nA feeling of unworthiness, sharp pain<br />\nWhen you are somewhere else, a guilty conscience,<br />\nA longing, and a dread of what&#8217;s in store,<br />\nA pulse rate for the &#8216;Guinness Book of Records&#8217; &#8211;<br />\nLife is now better that it was before.</p>\n<p>Although you have given me a raging temper,<br />\nInsomnia, a rising sense of panic,<br />\nA hopeless challenge, bouts of introspection,<br />\nRaw, bitten nails, a voice that&#8217;s strangely manic,<br />\nA selfish streak, a fear of isolation,<br />\nA silly smile, lips that are chapped and sore,<br />\nA running joke, a risk, an inspiration &#8211;<br />\nLife is now better that it was before.</p>\n<p>Although you have given me premonition,<br />\nChattering teeth, a goal, a lot to lose,<br />\nA granted wish, mixed motives, superstitions,<br />\nHang-ups and headaches, fear of awful news,<br />\nA bubble in my throat, a dare to swallow,<br />\nA crack of light under a closing door,<br />\nThe crude, fantastic prospect of forever &#8211;<br />\nLife is now better than it was before.</p>\n<h2>Marriage</h2>\n<p>A Marriage is a promise that two hearts gladly make.<br />\nA promise to be tender, to help, to give and take.<br />\nA marriage is a promise to be kind and understanding.<br />\nTo be thoughtful and considerate, fair and undemanding.<br />\nA marriage is a promise to share one life together&#8230;.<br />\nA love filled promise meant to be kept lovingly forever.</p>\n<h2>When You Met</h2>\n<p>When you met you were not planning to fall in love; you were not planning to feel so attracted to someone. But when you met you awakened feelings inside yourselves that you had forgotten existed.</p>\n<p>On the day you met, you did not realise how much your love would grow; that the attraction which first brought you together would reach beyond passion, to the comfort of knowing that you each had someone very special. Someone who would be not only a lover, but also a close friend.</p>\n<p>When you met you had no idea where your relationship would lead you, or how beautiful you would make each other&#8217;s world; but today you know that without a doubt the luckiest day of your lives was the day that you met.</p>\n<h2>A Love Poem (Dorothy Court)</h2>\n<p>Love. What is it?<br />\nYou cannot hold it, neither see it.<br />\nBut it is all around us.<br />\nIt is the essence of our lives.<br />\nSooner or later you are bound to meet it.<br />\nSome people go out to greet it.<br />\nIt is there; it is here;<br />\nit is gone; it is near.<br />\nIt is something we cannot afford to miss.<br />\nThis once in a while, this bliss.<br />\nThis thing called love.</p>\n<h2>Marriage is</h2>\n<p>Learning to give not always to take,<br />\nLearning to forgive each little mistake,<br />\nLearning to love whatever the cost,<br />\nAlways remember alone you&#8217;d be lost.<br />\nTrying so hard your partner to please,<br />\nTrying to save whilst paying the fees,<br />\nTrying to smile when things turn out wrong,<br />\nAlways remember to curb your tongue.<br />\nNever think of only yourself,<br />\nNever to say you wish you had wealth.<br />\nNever let you temper get hot,<br />\nAlways be thankful for what you have got.<br />\nIf you remember all of these things,<br />\nYou will discover the joys that it brings,<br />\nThen you&#8217;ll have what so many folk miss,<br />\nAlways you&#8217;ll have a marriage of bliss.</p>\n<h2>I love you because</h2>\n<p>I love you because you&#8217;re my future,<br />\nMy present and part of my past<br />\nMy world has been turning so quickly<br />\nAnd time just keeps moving so fast.<br />\nI love you because you have something<br />\nno ordinary person can give<br />\nA warmth that I&#8217;ll cling to forever &#8211;<br />\nHold on to so long as I live<br />\nI love you because your devotion<br />\nIs tender and wonderfully rare<br />\nCould anyone ever imagine?<br />\nThe magic moments we share?<br />\nI love you because you are truthful,<br />\nYour eyes hold the key to my heart<br />\nTell me you share my commitment,<br />\nAnd say we shall not be apart.<br />\nI love you because you are wonderful,<br />\nYou give me all that I need<br />\nA hug when I seek reassurance,<br />\nA smile if we have disagreed.<br />\nI love you because&#8230;.. I just love you,<br />\nFor too many reasons to say<br />\nAnd I&#8217;ll always be right here beside you,<br />\nA breath and a heartbeat away.</p>\n<h2>Where there is Love (Helen Steiner Rice)</h2>\n<p>Where there is love the heart is light.<br />\nWhere there is love the day is bright.<br />\nWhere there is love there is a song<br />\nTo help when things are going wrong.<br />\nWhere there is love there is a smile<br />\nTo make all things seem more worthwhile.<br />\nWhere there is love there&#8217;s quiet peace,<br />\nA tranquil place where turmoil&#8217;s cease &#8211;<br />\nLove changes darkness into light<br />\nAnd makes the heart take &#8220;wingless flight&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>A Wedding Message (Amanda Bradley)</h2>\n<p>To love is to share life together.<br />\nTo build special plans just for two.<br />\nTo work side by side,<br />\nAnd then smile with pride<br />\nAs, one by one, dreams all come true.<br />\nTo love is to help and encourage<br />\nWith smiles and sincere words of praise.<br />\nTo take time to share.<br />\nTo listen and care<br />\nIn tender, affectionate ways.<br />\nTo love is to have someone special<br />\nOn whom you can always depend<br />\nTo be there through the years,<br />\nSharing laughter and tears<br />\nAs a partner, a lover, a friend.<br />\nTo love is to make special memories<br />\nOf moments you love to recall.<br />\nOf all the good things<br />\nThat married life brings,<br />\nLove is the greatest of all.</p>\n<h2>Love</h2>\n<p>Love puts the music in laughter<br />\nThe beauty in song<br />\nThe warmth in a shoulder<br />\nThe gentle in strong<br />\nLove puts the magic in memories<br />\nThe sunshine in skies<br />\nThe goodness in giving<br />\nThe starlight in eyes<br />\nLove puts the fun in together<br />\nThe sad in apart<br />\nThe hope in tomorrow<br />\nThe joy in the heart.</p>\n<h2>Yes, I&#8217;ll Marry You (Pam Ayres)</h2>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;ll marry, my dear, and here&#8217;s the reason why;<br />\nSo I can push you out of bed when the baby starts to cry,<br />\nAnd if we hear a knocking and it&#8217;s creepy and it&#8217;s late,<br />\nI hand you the torch to see, and you investigate.<br />\nYes I&#8217;ll marry you, my dear, you may not apprehend it,<br />\nBut when the tumble-drier goes it&#8217;s you that has to mend it.<br />\nYou have to face the neighbour should our Labrador attack him,<br />\nAnd if a drunkard fondles me it&#8217;s you that has to whack him.<br />\nYes I&#8217;ll marry you, you&#8217;re virile and you&#8217;re lean,<br />\nMy house is like a pigsty you can help to keep it clean.<br />\nThat sexy little dinner which you served by candlelight,<br />\nAs I do chipolatas, you can cook it every night!<br />\nIt&#8217;s you who work the drill and put up curtain track,<br />\nAnd when I&#8217;ve got PMT it&#8217;s you who gets the flak,<br />\nI do see great advantages, but none of them for you,<br />\nAnd so before you see the light, I do, I do, I do !</p>\n<h2>An Excerpt from An American Indian Wedding Ceremony</h2>\n<p>May the sun bring you new strength by day,<br />\nMay the moon softly restore you by night,<br />\nMay the rain wash away your fears,<br />\nAnd the breeze invigorate your being,<br />\nMay you, all the days of your life together,<br />\nWalk gently through the world and know it&#8217;s beauty.<br />\nNow you will feel no rain,<br />\nFor each of you will be shelter for the other,<br />\nNow you will feel no cold,<br />\nFor each of you will be warmth to the other,<br />\nNow there is no more loneliness,<br />\nFor each of you will be company for the other,<br />\nNow you are two persons,<br />\nBut there is only one life before you.<br />\nGo to your dwelling,<br />\nEnter into the days of your life together<br />\nAnd may your days be good and long upon the earth.</p>\n<h2>Celtic Blessing</h2>\n<p>May peace guard<br />\nThe door of your house<br />\nThe door of your heart<br />\nMay the road rise to meet you,<br />\nAnd the sun stand at your shoulder<br />\nMay the wind be always at your back<br />\nAnd the rains fall softly upon your fields<br />\nMay life itself befriend you<br />\nEach day, each night<br />\nEach step of your journey.<br />\nMay peace be with you<br />\nAnd with your children,<br />\nFrom the day that we have here today<br />\nTo the day of the end of our lives,<br />\nUntil the day of the end of your lives.</p>\n",

They may be a family affected by drug, alcohol or physical abuse, chronic illness or disability of either the parents or the children; they may be homeless; they may be a one parent family where the parent is unable to work; or they may be a family where the child is the primary carer.<br />\nReading Family Aid distributes toys at Christmas to children aged 0-16 through the Toys &amp; Teens Appeal. If funds permit, they also provide outings throughout the year for children and their families who couldn&#8217;t afford to go otherwise. In 2018 over 1,700 children received a sack of toys at Christmas as a result of the Toys &amp; Teens Appeal. They also took 2 coaches of local disadvantaged families to Odds Farm for the day, arranged an outing for 100 children on the autistic spectrum and their families to Camp Mohawk, and took 300 children and their families to Bournemouth beach and the RockReef centre on the pier!</p>\n<p>Reading seems so prosperous that many people might find it hard to imagine there are desperately deprived families here. But in 2016, 24% of Reading&#8217;s children were living in poverty &#8211; that&#8217;s 10,181 children (source: <a href=\"http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/\">The End Child Poverty Coalition</a>). All the families referred to the group are in genuine need. They would not have any Christmas presents and would not have a day out otherwise. Reading Family Aid aims to offer them some relief from the harsh day-to-day realities of their lives &#8211; some of the extras that social services and other agencies can&#8217;t provide. Their motto is: Putting smiles on children&#8217;s faces.</p>\n<p>The charity is run entirely by volunteers and they have no premises or equipment so most of the money donated goes directly towards putting those smiles on faces.</p>\n<h3>South Central Ambulance Charity</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://sca-charity.org.uk/\">http://sca-charity.org.uk/</a></p>\n<p>The charity exists to help our local ambulance service help our community, and the money raised goes towards the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training and equipping volunteer community first responders (CFRs) &#8211; the people in your street who have been trained to provide a lifesaving response to their neighbours while an ambulance is on its way. The charity already has over 1000 volunteers trained to start saving lives while an ambulance is on its way and last year they went to 25,836 calls for help. Every volunteer costs about £2000 to train and equip and we rely 100% on donations to the charity to fund this activity.</li>\n<li>Training and equipping communities to save lives by providing more life-saving equipment (such as public access defibrillators), and giving local people the confidence to use them. We want to make sure that no-one in your region is more than 8 minutes away from a public access defibrillator, and we need to raise £1850 for every one we install.</li>\n<li>Enabling South Central Ambulance Service to say thank you to the men and women who provide our emergency care by investing in their ideas to develop the care they give in ways that go over and above what current NHS funding allows. For example, they wish to raise funds for more Lucas Devices across the SCAS regions. The LUCAS is a portable, easy-to-use device that delivers automated, guidelines-consistent chest compressions to improve blood flow in victims of cardiac arrest. LUCAS performs at a rate of 100 compressions per minute with a depth of 1.5 to 2 inches.</li>\n<li>SCA charity have recently raised funds to equip all frontline staff with Beanie Hats as these are not able to funded by SCAS, and as you can imagine sometimes being outside with a fallen patient for quite some time or with a mental health patient for hours can get very cold.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see the funds this charity raise are used for many causes from Life Saving Lucas&#8217;s to New Tables for Staff to sit and eat a meal at. Also this year&#8217;s restart a heart day saw us train over 10,000 Children in CPR across the South Central Ambulance Service Region.</p>\n<h3>Sport in Mind</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sportinmind.org/\">https://www.sportinmind.org/</a></p>\n<p>Sport in Mind are a fantastic local charity making a huge difference to peoples lives in Berkshire and Reading in particular.</p>\n<p>They are an independent mental health charity and were founded in Berkshire in 2010. They have a simple mission:</p>\n<p>&#8220;To improve the lives of people experiencing mental health problems through sport and physical activity&#8221;</p>\n<p>The charity has already become the UK&#8217;s leading mental health sports charity delivering physical activity projects in partnership with the NHS in order to promote mental wellbeing, improve physical health, combat social isolation, and empower people to move their lives forward in a positive direction.</p>\n<p>The charity&#8217;s services which are co-designed by people with personal experience of mental health problems and healthcare professionals have supported over 10,000 local people.</p>\n<p>The charity&#8217;s work is delivered to support the recovery and the charity believes everyone should have the opportunity to take part in sport and physical activity irrespective of how unwell they are.</p>\n<p>There are still many common misconceptions about mental illness in society today and Sport in Mind use the power of sport to bring people together to talk about mental health and change attitudes.</p>\n",

    "title": "Vehicle crossing policy",
    "content": "<ol>\n<li>The vehicle hard-standing area on property frontage should have minimum dimensions of at least 2.4m wide (along the boundary entry point) and a minimum 4.8m length (this is the minimum depth of property frontage required). Note: This is a minimum requirement; a greater size may be required to accommodate larger vehicles. A greater distance /depth may also be required to allow for property access/doorways etc. The vehicle hard-standing should be constructed before, or at the same time as the vehicle crossing is constructed. It is not permitted for vehicles to overhang the public highway as this can constitute an obstruction of the public highway under the Highways Act 1980.</li>\n<li>Some roads are classified as traffic sensitive and may not be suitable for a vehicle crossing. If your property is on a classified road, the new access will require planning permission before any work can be carried out and Development Control and/or Planning will be consulted as appropriate.</li>\n<li>If the proposed vehicle crossing is in a road where there is a formalised onstreet parking scheme and/or Traffic Regulation Order in place, Network Management will be consulted as appropriate.</li>\n<li>The entrance width/opening to the property frontage should be suitable for vehicle(s) to be able to park on hard-standing(s) perpendicular on property frontage (as explained in point 1 above). Entrance width/opening needs to be wide enough so that vehicles do not ‘bump up’ full height kerbs.</li>\n<li>A vehicle crossing should be a minimum distance of 10m away from a<br />\njunction.</li>\n<li>Visibility splays/sight lines should be acceptable to ensure safe<br />\naccess/egress from property.</li>\n<li>If any tree and/or root system would be affected by the proposed vehicle crossing, Planning and Parks will be consulted as appropriate.</li>\n<li>The total continual length of dropped kerb (including where shared with neighbouring property, ideally should not exceed 10m. Note: in situations where it would be greater than 10m, the decision on whether or not to approve will be at the Council’s discretion.</li>\n<li>In situations where a neighbouring property already has an established historical/legal vehicle crossing and there is insufficient space/gap between the crossings to install ‘transition kerbs’ and ‘full-height kerbing infill’, it may be necessary to extend the existing dropped kerb from the neighbouring property to create the new vehicle crossing (‘transition kerbs’ laid back to back are not normally accepted). This will depend on the location of the proposed vehicle crossing in relation to the neighbouring existing vehicle crossing. Effectively such a situation creates a shared vehicle crossing rather than two separately defined vehicle crossings. This will be at the Council’s discretion.</li>\n<li>Water run-off from private property onto the public highway is not<br />\npermitted. An appropriate method of drainage needs to be provided within the property curtilage including the use of suitable permeable surfacing materials.</li>\n<li>Planning permission is required for any hard standing (new or<br />\nrepair/replacement) at a property that is constructed of a non-porous<br />\nmaterial (tarmac, concrete or brick paving) in excess of 5 square metres and does not have surface water run off to a permeable or porous area within the boundaries of the property, e.g. lawn. Hard standing at other properties (including flats) is likely to require planning permission regardless of the proposed material (except some industrial/warehouse uses). It is recommended that you contact Planning on (0118) 937 3787 if you require further information. If you do not meet these requirements, planning permission will be required before any work can be carried out. (A copy of the planning permission will be required).</li>\n<li>If gravel is to be used as a permeable surfacing material to the hardstanding, a non–gravel apron/strip is required across the entrance<br />\nwidth/opening on the private property frontage to prevent the gravel from migrating onto the public highway.</li>\n<li>Vehicle crossing applications will not be approved in locations where there would be a substantial loss of public highway/Council maintained grass verge and/or have a detrimental effect on the local environment/street scene.</li>\n<li>The loss of an area of grass verge up to 8m2 is acceptable, however, if an area of between 8m2 and 15m2 of public highway /Council maintained grass verge is considered for removal, it will need to be replaced by a suitable permeable bituminous/tarmacadam material appropriate for use on the public highway and approved by the Council. This material will be applied to all of the crossing area to reduce the impact of surfacing a verge area.</li>\n<li>Street furniture (e.g. sign posts, street lighting columns) should be a<br />\nminimum distance of 1.0m from a vehicle crossing (top of transition kerb) to reduce risk of damage from turning vehicles. Note: where it is considered feasible/agreed by the Council to relocate/reposition street<br />\nfurniture/utility equipment so as not to impede a vehicle crossing, all costs associated with such work to be charged to vehicle crossing applicant and included in the cost estimate.</li>\n<li>Edging kerb or similar approved will normally be required as a demarcation between the back of footway/highway boundary and property frontage boundary.</li>\n<li>Utility covers/manhole covers within a vehicle crossing should be to the required specification/standard for vehicles to override (to be supplied by the relevant utility company as required). All work to utility covers/boxes/chambers should be carried out by relevant utility company (e.g. cover supply replacement/adjustment/ lowering etc.) to ensure that work is carried out in accordance with utility company’s requirements, specification and standards. Utility mains/services/equipment and plant may require lowering/repositioning/replacing as a result of a vehicle crossing<br />\napplication. Again, all such work will be carried out by the relevant utility company. The cost(s) for any utility works required will be charged to the vehicle crossing applicant and included in the cost estimate.</li>\n<li>Kerbing to vehicle crossings to match existing general ‘kerb type’ in the road where possible/practicable (e.g. granite kerbs/setts/conservation kerbs).</li>\n<li>Where an Access Protection Marking (APM) is to be installed, it will extend to the whole length/width of the vehicle crossing (from top of transition kerb to top of transition kerb), including across the whole length/width of shared vehicle crossings. It will not be permitted to install an APM to part/half of a vehicle crossing, even where there is a shared vehicle crossing (Refer to Council’s Access Protection Marking Policy).</li>\n<li>There may well be other site specific factors/requirements which need to be taken into account with a vehicle crossing application. These will be identified and considered as appropriate and will be at the Council’s discretion.</li>\n<li>All of the above vehicle crossing criteria will be considered as part of the site assessment.</li>\n<li>The Council’s decision on a vehicle crossing application is final, in its<br />\ncapacity as the Local Highway Authority.</li>\n<li>The vehicle crossing application fee is non-refundable. Applicants are<br />\nadvised to first check that their application meets the various criteria of this vehicle crossing policy before submitting it to the Council.</li>\n<li>The conditions above may be periodically reviewed and subject to change following consultation and Committee approval. Any breach of the conditions may result in formal action being taken.</li>\n</ol>\n",

The role instantly grabbed my attention because it was so varied, and had the challenges of helping to shape a new role.</p>\n<p>My role as a Housing Occupational Therapist is to support the Housing Team by providing professional and specialist assessments that offer efficient and cost effective housing solutions for older, disabled or vulnerable Reading Borough Council tenants. I assess applicants with a wide range of medical conditions and identify how accommodation can be adapted to meet their ongoing long term needs. This can include installation of stair-lifts, ramps and level access showers or any minor adaptations such as rails.</p>\n<p>I also visit empty properties to assist the Housing Officer to write a description to advertise properties on Homechoice Lettings, confirm mobility levels or advise what adaptations could be made. I am currently involved in liaising with the Housing Team on new build properties, looking at the layout of the properties, and make recommendations to meet the needs of disabled people.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4387 alignleft\" src=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Michelle_Chandler.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Chandler\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h2>Michelle Chandler, Senior Occupational Therapist for Adult Social Care, Directorate of Economic Growth and Neighbourhood Services</h2>\n<p>Hello I&#8217;m Michelle Chandler and I am an Occupational Therapist (OT) based in the Private Sector Housing Team. I am the first adult social care Occupational Therapist to be based in this team, as part of a new specialism for Occupational Therapists to support the process of disability grants. I am responsible for streamlining processes, improving services and service delivery, and supporting communication between the grants team and social services. I am also the lead for training newer Occupational Therapists in disability grants and major adaptations. I really enjoy mentoring people. Helping students and newly qualified staff through their careers has been one of the highlights of being in this role, as well as having the opportunity to develop the scope of the new Occupational Therapist position in the disabilities grants team.</p>\n<p>I love living and working in Reading. I grew up in various wards with a mum who is a nurse. I followed in her footsteps and joined Royal Berkshire Hospital in 2002, gaining my Occupational Therapist qualification in 2010. I worked as an OT Technician, then as a Locum outside of Reading, before joining the social services team in Reading Borough Council in 2014.</p>\n<p>Being an Occupational Therapist in Reading Borough Council is a great opportunity. There is a lot of variation so you definitely won&#8217;t get bored! We have the opportunity to specialise in a wide variety of areas, which will allow you to get in-depth knowledge and transfer the information to the wider OT community. Being able to specialise and share information ensures better service delivery for the service user, while also allowing us to follow our interests. There are also personal development opportunities, including the option of completing CPD (Clinical Person Development).</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4388 alignleft\" src=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pippa_Durrant.png\" alt=\"Pippa Durrant\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h2>Pippa Durrant, Senior Occupational Therapist, Directorate of Adult Social Care and Health</h2>\n<p>Being from Berkshire I have worked in most areas and up until a year ago I had not had the opportunity of working in Reading.  When the job came up for a senior post in the long term team I jumped at the chance.  I was excited at the thought of working in an area I was not overly familiar with but also with such a diverse population.  Reading presents with many challenges due to the dense population and it is the challenge of meeting such diverse need that attracted me to this post.  And I have not been disappointed.  There are of course limitations to the service we can provide but as occupational therapists we are creative and also excellent problem solvers and with such passionate support of our social work colleagues we are always able to adjust our ideas to allow for safe and effective therapy plans within service provision constraints.</p>\n<p>My role involves assessing for and providing equipment, working with the major and minor adaptation teams, supporting our social work colleagues with assessing care needs; completing manual handling assessments and creating bespoke independent living training plans for some of our clients.  I work with young and elderly adults with long term physical and learning disabilities.  We have excellent links with other community teams and local healthcare providers and working with them helps build our skill base even more.</p>\n<p>Not only does the team work incredibly hard to meet its client&#8217;s needs but the close and supportive nature of the team means that you are supported from the minute you walk through the door.  There are excellent training opportunities and any ideas you have about service development or alternative training opportunities they are willing to listen.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4389 alignleft\" src=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sharon_Reed.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Reed\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h2>Sharon Reed, Deputy&#8217;s Administrator Apprentice, Directorate of Adult Social Care and Health</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m Sharon Reed, and I have recently joined Reading Borough Council as an Apprentice with the Deputy&#8217;s Team for Adult Social Care.</p>\n<p>Becoming an apprentice with the council has been a really valuable experience. I have been the sole carer for my son for the past 16 years, and being a trainee in the council has allowed me to regain my own identity while being part of an amazing team and helping the communities that I grew up in. I thought being over 50 would work against me, but the council were very supportive in encouraging me to go onto the New Directions Trainee Scheme and then my current apprenticeship.</p>\n<p>I love working for the Deputy&#8217;s Team. Everyone has been so kind and helpful, and made me feel like I am part of the team. I can honestly say that I am also working for the best manager I have ever had. She not only supports me in learning the role, but provides support for my changing personal circumstances. It would be a dream come true to secure a permanent position with the council after finishing my apprenticeship, and I encourage others from various backgrounds to give apprenticeships with the council a try &#8211; you won&#8217;t regret it!</p>\n",

Introduction</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments provide additional financial support for claimants of Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit who are deemed by the Council to be in severe financial hardship or have exceptional circumstances, and need further assistance to meet their housing costs.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments can be paid in a lump sum or a series of payments to the applicant or a third party (such as a landlord) at the discretion of Reading Borough Council.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments are paid from a limited budget, and each decision is made based on information and evidence supplied with the application on its own merits. However, consideration will also be given to the remaining cash limit set by the Secretary of State, and the extent that a Discretionary Housing Payment can be used to assist the applicant.</p>\n<p>Due to the implications of the wider welfare reform changes, the Council will have to carefully target Discretionary Housing Payments to those people deemed to be in most need, which means that not all applications for additional discretionary payments under this scheme will be successful.</p>\n<p>In order to manage the Discretionary Housing Payment budget as effectively as possible we have introduced conditions to the majority of Discretionary Housing Payment awards, the use of conditionality has been perceived as good practice in most Local Authorities.</p>\n<p>Conditions ensure that claimants know what steps to take, and how to improve their situation and reduce their need for a further Discretionary Housing Payments. Where conditions have not been met, a further award may not be made.</p>\n<p>The Discretionary Housing Payment scheme is totally separate to Universal Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support. Reading Borough Council has a separate Discretionary Council Tax Support Payment scheme for assistance towards Council Tax liability.</p>\n<h2>2. Statement of objectives</h2>\n<p>Our Discretionary Housing Payment Policy has the following key objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To prevent homelessness by sustaining tenancies;</li>\n<li>To help people who have demonstrated they need additional financial support on account of medical grounds or on grounds of disability to meet their housing costs;</li>\n<li>To help people through personal crisis or difficult events who are facing severe financial hardship;</li>\n<li>To help people who are deemed to be facing severe financial hardship or difficult circumstances, as a result of the wider welfare reform changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Priority and non-priority groups have been established to ensure that the most vulnerable applicants are safeguarded and assisted with longer term awards. Short-term awards will be made to applicants falling outside the priority groups whilst advice and assistance is provided on what options are available to them and conditions put in place that they must meet to reduce their reliance on a Discretionary Housing Payment.</p>\n<h2>3. Priority groups</h2>\n<p>Priority Groups are defined as:</p>\n<p>People with health or medical problems who need access to local medical services or support that might not be available elsewhere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People with disabilities who receive informal care and support in their current neighbourhood from family and friends which would not be available in a new area. In this respect we would also consider families who have a child with a disability who rely heavily on local support networks.</li>\n<li>Vulnerable adults who have lived in the area for a long time and would find it difficult to establish support networks in a new area.</li>\n<li>Severely disabled tenants in substantially adapted properties.</li>\n<li>People requiring an extra room for a member of the family for medical reasons in line with the Council’s Allocations Scheme.</li>\n<li>People approaching Pension Credit age (up to 6 months before pension age).</li>\n<li>Pregnant women expecting their first child who require an extra room (up to 6 months prior to due date).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Non-priority groups</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments made to applicants outside the priority groups will have conditionality attached in the majority of cases, and will be for a short period.</p>\n<p>Non-priority applicants may be expected to attend a Debt Advice appointment as part of the assessment process.</p>\n<p>Any conditionality will be linked to increasing the applicant’s income, reducing their rental liability, bidding for, or finding alternative accommodation or reducing other outgoings.</p>\n<p>Examples of types of conditionality could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attending work related coaching with one of the Council’s partners;</li>\n<li>Actively looking for work, with or without the support of the Council, or one of our partners;</li>\n<li>Registering for housing and bidding for suitable properties in each cycle;</li>\n<li>Making use of HomeSwapper for mutual exchanges;</li>\n<li>Paying rent arrears;</li>\n<li>Receiving and acting on debt advice to increase income, reduce outgoings and prioritising debts from an organisation that qualified to provide debt advice;</li>\n<li>Engaging and acting on advice from specialist support services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The intention of any conditionality is to assist applicants to improve their situation and reduce their reliance on Discretionary Housing Payments; it is not a punitive measure.</p>\n<p>When making a repeat application, the applicant must have met the conditions applied to their previous award, and be able to set out what actions they have undertaken as a result of that support, and explain their next steps in order to reduce their reliance on Discretionary Housing Payment awards.</p>\n<p>Such applications may require an interview with a member of Reading Borough Council’s Debt Advice Team who will also consider the circumstances of each individual case before any further award can be made.</p>\n<h2>5. Criteria for an award</h2>\n<p>Before a Discretionary Housing Payment can be considered, the applicant must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be receiving Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit for the period assistance is being applied for; and</li>\n<li>Complete a Discretionary Housing Payment application (including income and expenditure details); and</li>\n<li>Have a shortfall between the amount of Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit and their housing costs; and</li>\n<li>Be considered to need additional help with their housing costs; and</li>\n<li>Must demonstrate that they require additional financial assistance under this scheme, providing any supplementary information, including medical evidence, where applicable, to support their application; and</li>\n<li>Explain what other options they have considered to try and meet the shortfall in their housing costs, such as:<br />\na) Receiving Debt Advice;<br />\nb) Reducing non-essential expenditure;<br />\nc) Ensuring all eligible welfare benefits have been claimed;<br />\nd) Increasing their hours of work;<br />\ne) Receiving a contribution from other adults living in the property;<br />\nf) Renegotiating their rent with their landlord;<br />\ng) Moving to cheaper suitable alternative accommodation;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When reapplying for a Discretionary Housing Payment after conditions have been set, the claimant must provide details/evidence that conditions have been met within the specified timescale. Failure to do so will mean the application is unsuccessful.</p>\n<h2>6. Examples where Discretionary Housing Payments will be considered</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To support foster carers who are deemed to require additional help due to foster children not being recognised within their Housing Benefit assessment or Housing Costs element of Universal Credit;</li>\n<li>To support young people leaving Local Authority care;</li>\n<li>Where a disabled person’s accommodation has been substantially adapted to meet their needs and where they are deemed to require additional financial assistance to meet their housing costs (this could also include instances where an additional bedroom is used to store medical equipment, such as a dialysis machine);</li>\n<li>To support people who on medical grounds are required to have an additional bedroom within their property for a disabled member of their household, which is not recognised within the Housing Benefit scheme or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit and who face higher housing costs;</li>\n<li>To support households with disabled children who require overnight carer;</li>\n<li>people who are affected by the Benefit Cap;</li>\n<li>To support people who have a reduction in their Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit, due to the social housing under-occupation rules and who are deemed to be experiencing exceptional circumstances;</li>\n<li>Where someone in the household is expecting a baby within 6 months, resulting in the need for larger accommodation, (including those persons currently in shared accommodation or subject to an under-occupation reduction);</li>\n<li>To support ex-homeless applicants settle in the community;</li>\n<li>Restrictions in Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit due to Local Housing Allowance rates, where a person’s circumstances are considered to be exceptional;</li>\n<li>Families with a child temporarily in care who is expected to return home;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where a person’s move away from an area could jeopardise their employment;</li>\n<li>To cover a rent shortfall to prevent a family from becoming homeless, or while the Council explores alternative housing options;</li>\n<li>In circumstances where a person has an unavoidable rent liability on two homes, where Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit cannot be paid on both.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Examples where Discretionary Housing Payments cannot be<br />\nconsidered</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying ineligible service or support charges;</li>\n<li>Paying increases in rent due to outstanding rent arrears;</li>\n<li>Shortfalls caused by sanctions and/or reductions in benefits;</li>\n<li>Where a person does not qualify for any Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit;</li>\n<li>Shortfalls caused by Housing Benefit overpayment recovery;</li>\n<li>Shortfalls caused by overpayment recovery from a Universal Credit award;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>8. Rent in advance, deposits and removal costs</h2>\n<p>The Discretionary Housing Payment budget is insufficient to cover every applicants ongoing rent shortfall. In order to provide long term solutions priority will be given to applicants who are moving to more affordable accommodation where no other funding is available.</p>\n<p>Where the applicant’s current accommodation is unaffordable, a decision will be made if it would be more cost effective to provide financial assistance to help them move to more affordable accommodation, instead of providing short term financial assistance to cover any shortfall in rent.<br />\nWhen considering applications for rent in advance, deposits or removal costs the affordability of the new accommodation will be considered, and any deposit or rent in advance owed to the applicant from a previous property will be taken into account.</p>\n<p>Rent in advance and deposits will normally be paid to the landlord.</p>\n<h2>9. Assessment of applications</h2>\n<p>When making a decision on whether to award a Discretionary Housing Payment, we will take into account the following objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The reasons why the applicant’s circumstances should be considered as being exceptional;</li>\n<li>The size of the shortfall between the rent and Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit, and the reasons for it;</li>\n<li>The length of Discretionary Housing Payment award being applied for;</li>\n<li>The financial impact of any special needs, health or social problems the applicant or their family have;</li>\n<li>What impact not awarding a Discretionary Housing Payment is likely to have on the Council’s finances and services (especially homelessness);</li>\n<li>The amount of money remaining in the Discretionary Housing Payment budget;</li>\n<li>The extent to which the applicant has met previous conditions;</li>\n<li>The impact of any actions that the applicant has taken to contribute towards the difficulties they are facing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When calculating income, Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance (both care and mobility components) and Personal Independent Payments (daily living and mobility) will be disregarded.</p>\n<h2>10. Procedure for making a Discretionary Housing Payment award</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Each request for Discretionary Housing Payments will be considered on an<br />\nindividual basis;</li>\n<li>Consideration will be given to the remaining Discretionary Housing Payment budget, and the extent that financial assistance can help overcome the client’s difficulties;</li>\n<li>Average essential expenditure figures will be used when considering exceptional financial hardship;</li>\n<li>Entitlement to Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit will be checked before awarding a Discretionary Housing Payment;</li>\n<li>A Discretionary Housing Payment will not be awarded until outstanding<br />\nassessments of Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit have been completed;</li>\n<li>Discretionary Housing Payments will not be paid while entitlement to Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit is suspended;</li>\n<li>The start date of a Discretionary Housing Payment will be the Monday following the application being received and not back dated, unless there are continuous exceptional circumstances;</li>\n<li>The decision-maker will signpost applicants to other internal departments of the Council, such as Housing Advice or Social Services or to other external agencies if it is considered that this would help;</li>\n<li>A decision will be made within 10 working days of receiving the Discretionary Housing Payment application, along with any supporting evidence;</li>\n<li>All decisions will be notified in writing and will include information on how to request a review;</li>\n<li>Discretionary Housing Payments will be awarded for fixed period of time according to the individual circumstances of each case;</li>\n<li>Longer term Discretionary Housing Payment awards will end at the end of each financial year;</li>\n<li>The amount of the award and the period it covers will be decided by Reading Borough Council;</li>\n<li>When a Discretionary Housing Payment ends, the applicant will have to reapply by completing a new application;</li>\n<li>A repeat Discretionary Housing Payment application will be considered afresh, and not automatically re-awarded;</li>\n<li>Where appropriate the applicant will be expected to provide evidence that they have looked for alternative accommodation, sought advice or tried to increase their income;</li>\n<li>A Discretionary Housing Payment may be refused if the applicant has not followed instructions or advice. For example, contact and work with their Housing Officer, actively look for less expensive or smaller accommodation or seek employment;</li>\n<li>Where the Discretionary Housing Payment budget is exhausted prior to the end of the financial year 2018/19, it will not be possible for us to award any further payments under this policy even where an applicant meets the qualifying criteria;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>11. Who can claim Discretionary Housing Payments?</h2>\n<p>In most cases the person claiming Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit will make the application for Discretionary Housing Payments. However, we will also accept applications from someone acting on behalf of the person concerned, such as an appointee or advocate if the applicant is vulnerable and requires support or they have requested someone to act on their behalf.</p>\n<p>In all cases the applicant must provide the information requested on the Discretionary Housing Payment application form which includes income and expenditure details, and an explanation of the applications situation.</p>\n<h2>12. How to claim Discretionary Housing Payments</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments can be claimed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contacting Reading Borough Council’s Customer Services Team on 0118 937 3707 or by visiting customer services on the ground floor of the Civic Centre, or;</li>\n<li>Completing the <a href=\"https://reading-self.achieveservice.com/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-09fa4df3-0876-4372-88ba-2cad4b0478f4/AF-Stage-3693a400-54d6-451d-b220-9f072c7c24cb/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2F&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2F&amp;category=AF-Category-0c39d40f-83aa-4cef-9790-1719ad0c268a\">online application form</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>13. Who we can pay the Discretionary Housing Payments to</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments will generally be paid directly to the person claiming the Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit, or the landlord/company their Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit is paid to.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payment for Council tenants will be credited directly to their rent account.</p>\n<h2>14. When does the application have to be made?</h2>\n<p>There are no set rules regarding when a Discretionary Housing Payment application can be made. An application can only be considered when Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit is in payment.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payment applications should be made as soon as the need arises as backdated payments will only be awarded in exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>A Discretionary Housing Payment award will end if a claimant migrates from Housing Benefit to Universal Credit, a new Discretionary Housing Payment application will be required from the date Universal Credit Housing Costs Element was applied for.</p>\n<h2>15. Discretionary Housing Payment disputes</h2>\n<p>Where the applicant is dissatisfied with a decision they will need to write to the Entitlement and Assessment Team within one month of the date of notification and request a stage one review of the decision.</p>\n<p>The letter must state why they disagree with the decision made and, if necessary, provide reasonable evidence. A different Officer will consider the request and any new evidence or information within a month, and request additional information or evidence before making a decision.</p>\n<p>Where additional information or evidence is not provided, the review will be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Once the decision has been reviewed a letter will be sent advising whether the original decision has been revised or the grounds why the review was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>If the applicant is dissatisfied with the outcome of the stage one review, they will need to write to the Entitlement and Assessment Team within one month of the stage one decision notification to request a stage two review.<br />\nThe letter must state why they still disagree with the decision made and, if necessary, provide reasonable evidence.</p>\n<p>A review panel formed by Council representatives will consider the stage two review request, and any new evidence or information and make a final decision within a month regarding the person’s application for Discretionary Housing Payments.</p>\n<p>Once the review panel has considered the stage two review a letter will be sent advising whether the decision has been revised or the grounds why the review was unsuccessful. This will be the final stage of the dispute process.</p>\n<p>There is no right of appeal to a Social Security Tribunal against the Council’s decision to disallow an application for Discretionary Housing Payments. The route of judicial review is available, and the local government ombudsman if a person considers there to be maladministration.</p>\n<h2>16. Change of Circumstances</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of a Discretionary Housing Payment award, a person will still be under a duty to notify the Entitlement and Assessment Team of all relevant changes in their circumstances, in line with the same reporting requirements they have with their Housing Benefit claim or Universal Credit claim.</p>\n<p>Our benefit notifications will also outline specific changes of circumstances that a person will need to report, since this may affect their Discretionary Housing Payment award or the period for which it is granted.</p>\n<p>The Council may revise a Discretionary Housing Payment award if the applicant’s circumstances change.</p>\n<h2>17. When we will stop paying Discretionary Housing Payments</h2>\n<p>We will stop paying Discretionary Housing Payments when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is deemed that a person no longer requires Discretionary Housing Payments following an in-year change in their circumstances; or</li>\n<li>Discretionary Housing Payments are paid due to an official error; or</li>\n<li>The Council decides that a person has misrepresented their circumstances or failed to disclose a relevant material fact, in relation to their application for Discretionary Housing Payments; or</li>\n<li>Entitlement to Housing Benefit ends or housing costs element within Universal Credit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>18. Overpaid Discretionary Housing Payments</h2>\n<p>The Council will decide if it is appropriate to recover an overpayment of Discretionary Housing Payment, and will make every effort to minimise overpayments of Discretionary Housing Payment.</p>\n<p>Overpaid Discretionary Housing Payments will be recovered where it is held that the applicant, or a person acting on their behalf, has misrepresented their circumstances or where they have failed to disclose a relevant material fact.</p>\n<p>We may also seek to recover overpaid Discretionary Housing Payments if we establish that payments have been made as a result of an error made when the claim was first determined.</p>\n<p>Where it is decided to recover an overpaid Discretionary Housing Payment the Council will issue an invoice to the person that received the Discretionary Housing Payment. The Council will consider reasonable repayment plans where appropriate.</p>\n<p>A written explanation of how the overpayment occurred, and the periods and amounts to which it relates will be sent accordingly. Discretionary Housing Payment overpayments will not be recovered from payments of Housing Benefit or the Housing Element of Universal Credit, but may be recovered from any future Discretionary Housing Payment awards.</p>\n<p>Where the applicant disagrees with a decision to recover an overpayment they will need to follow the Discretionary Housing Payment dispute progress above.</p>\n<h2>19. Policy review</h2>\n<p>This policy will be reviewed annually, or in response to any legislative changes, welfare reform or other factors that impact on its effectiveness.</p>\n<h2>20. Governing legislation</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Financial Assistance regulations (S.I.2001/1167) as amended by the Council Tax Benefit Abolition (Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/458), which came into force on 1 April 2013.</p>\n<p>Article 7 of the Discretionary Housing Payment (Grants) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/2340).</p>\n<p>Universal Credit (Consequential, Supplementary, Incidental and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/630), which came into force on 29 April 2013.

    "content": "<p>Reading Borough Council is responsible for recovering money owed to it in respect of debts arising under the Social Security Administration Act 1992. From April 2013, Local Authorities have been given the power to recover overpaid Housing Benefit by deductions from earnings without the need to apply for a court order. This is done by using Direct Earnings Attachments (or DEA).</p>\n<p>Local Authorities were given this power by The Social Security (Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 2013. The full regulations can be found on this website &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/\">http://www.legislation.gov.uk</a></p>\n<h2>Why we use a DEA</h2>\n<p>Not everyone enters into a voluntary repayment agreement. DEAs give us the opportunity to recover overpaid benefits from debtors who are employed if they either refuse to repay, are unable to agree an acceptable repayment plan or who have defaulted on a voluntary repayment arrangement.</p>\n<h2>Employers have to implement a DEA for the Council</h2>\n<p>You have a legal obligation to do so unless you are a new business (i.e. started trading within the current financial year), or a micro business (having fewer than 10 employees). In such cases you are not obliged to operate a DEA although you may do so if this is agreed with your employee. If you fail to comply with your duties, you could be subject, on conviction, to a fine of up to £1000.</p>\n<h2>If your payroll software has not been updated to allow for DEAs</h2>\n<p>As this is a new procedure, it may be that your computerised system has not yet been updated to deal with DEAs. The Department for Work and Pensions is currently working with the Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals, Employer Representatives and Payroll Software providers in order to develop the right long term solution but until your software is changed, you will also need to follow the instructions below as well as the general guidance in this document. Once your system is updated, the information on this first page may no longer be needed.</p>\n<p>Until your software is updated, if you are using a computerised payroll system and you receive a request to set up a DEA you will need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Manually calculate the amount to deduct from earnings. <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/deaemployer#Amount%20to%20deduct\">Instructions</a></li>\n<li>Manually check whether there are any other orders currently in place &#8211; as the DEA may take priority over these. <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/deaemployer#Other%20court%20orders\">Full list of the orders and how they may impact on a DEA</a></li>\n<li>In cases where the DEA does take priority over another order, consider whether other orders need to cease or deduction amounts be recalculated.</li>\n<li>Ensure, in cases where other orders cannot be applied that these are removed manually from the payroll system and subsequently re-instated once a DEA ceases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If, after reading through this guidance, you still have unanswered queries, please telephone the Customer Contact Team on 0118 937 3707.</p>\n<h2>Direct Earnings Attachments &#8211; background information</h2>\n<p>A DEA has its own regulations which follow some of the workings of a Deduction from Earnings Order (DEO) and some workings of an Attachment of Earnings Order (AEO). A DEA does not replace any of these other orders and you may still receive requests to implement deductions for a DEO or AEO for your employees.</p>\n<h3>Your responsibilities</h3>\n<p>As an employer, you have a legal obligation to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a Direct Earnings Attachment when we ask you to make deductions from the employee&#8217;s net earnings.</li>\n<li>Make payments of the amounts deducted to us by the 19<sup>th</sup> day of the month following the month the deduction is made.</li>\n<li>Keep a record of each deduction taken and the employee from whose earnings it was made.</li>\n<li>Continue to operate the DEA until the balance is paid in full, or your employee leaves your employment.</li>\n<li>Ensure you take the right amount from your employee&#8217;s earnings each week or month and pay it to us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you fail to comply with your duties, you could be subject, on conviction, to a fine of up to £1000.</p>\n<h3>Providing information</h3>\n<p>a)  You have a duty to notify us if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We ask you to operate a DEA for someone who does not work for you.</li>\n<li>An employee for whom you are operating a DEA leaves your employment.</li>\n<li>You are a new business (i.e. started trading within the current financial year), or a micro business (having fewer than 10 employees), as defined in the Regulations. If you are a new or micro business you are not obliged to operate a DEA although you may do so if this is agreed with your employee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must write to us at the address shown on this letter within 10 days if any of the above applies to you. You should also let us know if your business ceases trading.</p>\n<p>b) You have a duty to notify your employee in writing of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amount of the deduction taken, including any amount taken for administrative costs. (see section 6.2 on administrative costs). If this information is shown on their pay slip, it will suffice.</li>\n<li>How that deduction was calculated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must do this (and record it) no later than the payday after the one on which the deduction for the DEA was taken.</p>\n<h2>How to operate a DEA</h2>\n<h3>The notice from the Council</h3>\n<p>This letter (officially called a notice) tells you to apply a DEA for your employee and gives you the information you will need in order to apply it. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name and address and national insurance number of the person from whose wages you will make the deduction.</li>\n<li>If we have it, their staff number, pay roll number or similar identifying number.</li>\n<li>The percentage rates at which deductions are to be made.</li>\n<li>The proportion of their wages which is protected (see section 6.2 (a))</li>\n<li>When to send us payments.</li>\n<li>The address to which you are to send the payments if you are going to pay by cheque.</li>\n<li>Details of the account into which the payments are to be transferred if you are paying us by direct credit transfer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The deductions</h3>\n<p>You will need to check that your employee earns enough to allow a deduction to be made. If he/she does, you then calculate how much to take from their earnings using the information provided by the Council and make the deductions.</p>\n<h3>The payments to the Council</h3>\n<p>Once you have taken the money, you must pay it over to the Council within set time limits. We will ask you to make payments in line with your payroll, so if your employee is paid weekly or monthly, you should pay us at the same time.</p>\n<p>However if your employee is paid weekly you must still calculate and deduct the payment every week, but you can pay us 4 weekly if you prefer.

For example:</p>\n<p>The employee received one weeks wage and 2 weeks holiday pay. Total net payment for 3 weeks = £850.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£850 ÷ 3 = £283.33</li>\n<li>£283.33 x 11% = £31.17</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total deduction from the net wage for 3 weeks of £850 = £93.51 (£31.17 x 3).</p>\n<h4>k) Rounding</h4>\n<p>The exact amount of the net wage is used against table A &amp; B. If the percentage amount calculated results in a fraction of a penny, it is rounded to the nearest whole penny, with a result of exactly half a penny being rounded down to the nearest whole penny below, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net wage £235.63 per week\n<ul>\n<li>£235.63 x 7% = £16.4941</li>\n<li>Weekly deduction = £16.49</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Net wage £1547.99 per month\n<ul>\n<li>£1547.99 x 11% = £170.278</li>\n<li>Monthly deduction = £170.28</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>l) Administrative costs &#8211; what you can charge your employee</h4>\n<p>For each pay period when you calculate the DEA deduction, you may also take up to £1 from your employee&#8217;s earnings towards administrative costs. You can take this even if it reduces the employee&#8217;s income below the protected earnings proportion.</p>\n<h2>Failing to take deductions or making incorrect deductions</h2>\n<p>If you fail to take a deduction from the employee&#8217;s net earnings when you should have or take an incorrect amount you should correct this on the next payday or paydays.</p>\n<p>Where the incorrect amount is because the deduction was less that the amount specified under the regulations then you should first;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduct the amount required for the current pay period.</li>\n<li>Then include the difference between the incorrect and correct amount for the previous period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where the incorrect amount is because the deduction was more than the amount specified under the regulations then you should first;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduct the amount required for the current pay period.</li>\n<li>Then reduce that deduction amount by the excess previously taken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that if a deduction is reduced in any week or month simply because the DEA along with any other orders in place will breach the protected earnings limit of 60% this is NOT considered a shortfall as described above.</p>\n<p>A shortfall only occurs when an incorrect amount has been deducted in error, or where one or more deductions have been missed.</p>\n<p><strong>Pl</strong><strong>ease also note that the total to be deducted, including adjustments for an incorrect deduction, along with other deductions in place, must not leave the employee with less than the protected earnings limit of 60% for each pay period.</strong></p>\n<h2><a id=\"Other court orders\"></a>If your employee has other court orders against them</h2>\n<p>Courts can make orders that mean you must take money directly from your employee&#8217;s earnings in a similar way to how we ask you to make deductions for a DEA. For example, your employee may have an Attachment of Earnings Order (England &amp; Wales) or a Deduction from Earnings Order (for Child Maintenance). The DEA can be imposed without a court order, but if your employee has any other deduction orders against them there are rules that tell you which money you should take first.</p>\n<p>If your employee has one or more of the following in place, they will take priority over a DEA:</p>\n<h3><strong>Englan</strong><strong>d &amp; Wales</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduction from Earnings Order (DEO) from the Child Maintenance Group (CMG)</li>\n<li>Attachment of Earnings Order (AEO) for Maintenance or Fines</li>\n<li>Council Tax Attachment of Earnings Order (CTAEO)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scotland</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduction of Earnings Order (DEO) from CMG</li>\n<li>Earnings Arrestment (EA)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Student Loans</h3>\n<p>A student loan repayment also takes priority over a DEA. This applies to both England &amp; Wales and Scotland.</p>\n<p>Once these priority orders have been taken into account in your calculation a DEA will then take priority in relation to other orders or notices <strong>i</strong><strong>n date order</strong>(in Scotland this will be the date they were received). The amount you can deduct will be subject to the available net earnings above the protected earnings limit of 60% of net earnings.</p>\n<h2>If your employee does not earn enough to make the deduction</h2>\n<p>If the weekly or monthly earnings are below the threshold (see table A &amp; B) you cannot calculate a DEA deduction.</p>\n<p>You must tell the Council why a deduction cannot be made by using a Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule.</p>\n<p>You must continue to calculate whether a DEA deduction can be made, each pay period until either we tell you to stop or your employee leaves your employment.</p>\n<h2>Your employee thinks the amount they owe is wrong</h2>\n<p>If your employee thinks that the amount of money they owe is wrong, you should advise them to urgently contact the Benefits Debt Recovery Team on the telephone number at the top of the letter they received about the Direct Earnings Attachment.</p>\n<h2>Your employee thinks the amount of the deduction is too much</h2>\n<p>If they think that the amount you have calculated is too much, you should first check that the amount being deducted is correct according to table A or B, on the basis of their earnings and other orders in place. If the amount is correct, you should explain that you have made the deduction as instructed to do so. If they feel that this is too much for them to manage, you should advise them to contact us.</p>\n<h2>Operating a Direct Earnings Attachment</h2>\n<p>Once you have started operating a DEA, you must continue to make payments to us until we tell you to stop or you have deducted the maximum amount that needs to be recovered from the earnings. We would contact you if the amount deducted should change.</p>\n<p>If there is a change of circumstances which means that you can no longer operate the DEA, you must notify is in writing within 10 days of that change happening. In the first instance though, please telephone us to let us know as we may be able to speed up the administration process.</p>\n<p>If you need to tell us about a change like this, please telephone the Customer Contact Service Team on 0118 37 3707 or e-mail us at <a href=\"mailto:Benefits@reading.gov.uk%20\">Benefits@reading.gov.uk</a></p>\n<h2>Making payments to Reading Borough Council</h2>\n<p>On receipt of a notice to operate a DEA, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make regular payments to us until we tell you to stop or the maximum amount to be recovered has been taken from your employees earnings.</li>\n<li>Pay the amount you have taken from your employee&#8217;s wages over to Reading Borough Council as soon as possible, but no later than the 19th day of the month following the month in which you have taken it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if you take the money on 30th September, you must send it to us before 19<sup>th</sup> October. If you take the money on 1st October, you must send it to us before 19<sup>th</sup> November.</p>\n<h3>By BACS (Automated Credit Transfer)</h3>\n<p>This is our preferred method of payment, because of its security and quick clearance times. When setting up a payment by this method, you will need the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Borough of Reading bank sort code &#8211; 30-91-31</li>\n<li>The Borough of Reading bank account number &#8211; 00271502</li>\n<li>Account Name &#8211; Reading Borough Council</li>\n<li>Invoice number</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the payment is for one employee, enter the employees invoice number. If the payment covers multiple employees, you will need to send multiple payments quoting each individual invoice number to ensure payments are allocated correctly.</p>\n<p>If you are paying by BACS, you will need to send a Direct Earnings Attachment payment schedule to us so we know who the payment refers to. </p>\n<h3>Paying by cheque</h3>\n<p>If you need to pay by cheque, please make it payable to &#8216;Reading Borough Council&#8217; and write the employee&#8217;s LA invoice number on the back of the cheque.</p>\n<p>Please send the cheque to: Reading Borough Council, Civic Offices, Bridge Street, Reading, RG1 2LU.</p>\n<p>If you are paying by cheque, you will need to attach a Direct Earnings Attachment payment schedule to the cheque so we know who the payment refers to. </p>\n<h3>Paying by telephone</h3>\n<p>If your bank offers a bill paying facility and you wish to make a payment using the telephone/internet banking/automated credit transfer, use the bank account details above.</p>\n<h3><strong>Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule</strong></h3>\n<p>For payments by BACS (Automated Credit Transfer) or cheque you must send us a Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule. A blank schedule for you to use copy as many times as you need has been included in this document leaflet. The Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule must include the following details for each person for whom you were asked to make deductions from earnings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their full names (forenames and surname).</li>\n<li>Their invoice Number as shown on the DEA notice you were sent.</li>\n<li>The amount of the deduction (in pounds sterling) that has been deducted or</li>\n<li>The reason why a deduction cannot be made when appropriate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The amount of the automated credit transfer or cheque must be the same as the total amount of deductions shown on the Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule. Please do not send cash through the post.</p>\n<h3>E-mail us the Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule</h3>\n<p>If you prefer, you can e-mail an electronic copy of the schedule to us at <a href=\"mailto:bankrec@reading.gov.uk\">bankrec@reading.gov.uk</a> and the payment can follow. Please include &#8216;DEA notice&#8217; in the subject of your e-mail.</p>\n<h2><strong>Examples of Direct Earnings Attachment in practice</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Exampl</strong><strong>e 1 &#8211; A weekly paid earner with no prior attachment orders.</strong></h3>\n<p>A person with net earnings of £385 per week will have a deduction of £57.75 per week (in accordance with the deduction rates table at 15%</p>\n<h3><strong>Exampl</strong><strong>e 2 &#8211; A weekly paid earner with an existing attachment order for child maintenance</strong></h3>\n<p>A person with net earnings of £250 per week with an existing attachment order of £60 per week for child maintenance will have a deduction of £17.50 (in accordance with the deduction table at 7%)</p>\n<h3>Example 3 &#8211; A monthly paid earner with existing priority attachment orders.</h3>\n<p>A person with net earnings of £1620 per month should have a DEA deduction of £243 (in accordance with the deduction table at 15%). However, this deduction in addition to the existing deductions of £486, will breach the protected earnings limit of 60%. The maximum deduction we can make in this instance would be £162.</p>\n<h4>Calculation:</h4>\n<p>Earnings x 40% = £648 (maximum amount for total deductions)<br />Existing priority attachment order in place = £486<br />DEA deduction = £243<br />£648 &#8211; £486 = £162 (maximum amount available for the DEA deduction)</p>\n<p>Therefore, although the deduction rates table states that a deduction of £243 should be taken, the protected earnings limit means that the amount will be restricted to £162.</p>\n<h2>Information and advice</h2>\n<p>If you need more information about, or help to operate a Direct Earnings Attachment, please ring Reading Borough Council Customer Service Team on 0118 937 3707.</p>\n<p>We will be happy to discuss any questions you may have.</p>\n<h2>Direct Earnings Attachment &#8211; Employers Checklist</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Does the person named in the notice work for you?<br />YES &#8211; go to 2<br />NO &#8211; tell the Council within 10 days<br /> </li>\n<li>Are you a new or micro business? <br />YES &#8211; contact the Council on 0118 937 3707<br />NO &#8211; go to 3<br /> </li>\n<li>Are there any orders for deductions already in place that will take priority over the DEA and prevent it being set up?<br />YES &#8211; tell the Council within 10 days<br />NO &#8211; go to 4<br /> </li>\n<li>Calculate your employees net earnings for DEA purposes<br /> </li>\n<li>Do they earn enough to allow deductions to be made?<br />YES &#8211; go to 6<br />NO &#8211; tell the Council within 10 days<br /> </li>\n<li>Decide how much of their net earnings will be deducted<br /> </li>\n<li>If you deduct that amount, will they be left with less than 60% of their wages &#8211; the protected amount?<br />YES &#8211; If possible, adjust your deductions level to leave them with 60% of their net earnings OR within 10 days, tell the Council that no deductions can be made.<br />NO &#8211; go to 8<br /> </li>\n<li>Make sure the total amount deducted through this and previous deductions are not more than the total amount stated in the notice.<br /> </li>\n<li>Make the necessary arrangements to your payroll for the deduction to be made.<br /> </li>\n<li>Notify your employee of the amount to be deducted no later than the pay day on which the deduction is made.<br /> </li>\n<li>Pay the amount deducted from your employee&#8217;s earnings to the Council no later than the 19<sup>th</sup> day of the month following the month in which the deduction was made. If paying by BACS or cheque, send the Council a Direct Earnings Attachment payment schedule with details of the payment.</li>\n</ol>\n",

It is not possible to apply directly to the Insolvency Service yourself.</p>\n<p>The Council has approved intermediaries &#8211; contact the Debt Advice Team on 0118 937 2197 for advice and/or to apply.</p>\n<p>To qualify for a DRO you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be unable to pay your debts and</li>\n<li>Your total debts must be £20,000 or less and</li>\n<li>Your assets must be worth a total of £1,000 or less and</li>\n<li>You won’t have a car or motor bike worth £1,000 or more and</li>\n<li>You will have a maximum of £50 a month available income after normal household expenses are taken into account and</li>\n<li>You must live in in England or Wales (or have lived or run a business in England or Wales in the last three years) and</li>\n<li>You can’t have had DRO in the last six years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What debts can be included in my DRO?</p>\n<p>As long as your total debts are not more than the £20,000 limit your debts can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Priority debts (such as rent arrears*, gas and electricity debts with your current supplier, arrears on your phone bill if you need to keep it as an essential service, Council Tax, Business Rates arrears and Income tax, VAT and National Insurance arrears.<br />\n*If you include rent arrears in your DRO your landlord can still take court action to evict you, but they can’t recover rent arrears you build up before your DRO. Please seek specialist Debt Advice before considering a DRO if you have rent arrears.</li>\n<li>Credit debts (such as water rates arrears, credit cards and store cards, bank overdrafts and bank loans, loans from finance companies, catalogue debts, home collected credit, benefit overpayments**, family or personal debts, hire purchase and conditional sale agreements if you are in arrears (you may be able to exclude this type of debt if you are not in arrears), hire agreements, parking penalty charges, mortgage shortfalls (money you owe if your house was sold for less than the outstanding mortgage).<br />\nYou may also owe debts from your small business (such as money owed to employees, debts to customers who have paid for goods or services that can’t supply and debts to suppliers).<br />\n**Benefit overpayments can’t be recovered by any method, including deductions from your ongoing benefits, if they are included in a DRO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>If you miss a creditor</h3>\n<p>You can&#8217;t add more debts after you have submitted your application. If you aren’t sure what debts to include contact the Debt Advice Team.</p>\n<p>Any creditors missed from your DRO application can continue to take action to recover the money you owe them and you will need to negotiate repayments separately with them. If this happens contact the Debt Advice Service.</p>\n<p>If a missed debt takes your total debts over £20,000 the Official Receiver may end or ‘revoke’ your DRO.</p>\n<h3>Excluded debts</h3>\n<p>Some debts do not count towards your £20,000 limit including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magistrates’ court fines</li>\n<li>Maintenance, Child Support Agency (CSA) and Child Maintenance Service (CMS) payments and arrears</li>\n<li>Student loans</li>\n<li>Budgeting loans and crisis loans</li>\n<li>Money owed under a ‘criminal confiscation order’ and debts incurred through fraud</li>\n<li>Debts resulting from certain personal injury claims against you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though they don’t count towards your DRO you must list these debts on your application. You are still liable to repay these debts in full.</p>\n<h3>How much does a DRO cost?</h3>\n<p>The Insolvency Service charges £90 for a DRO (you won’t get a reduction if you are on benefits or a low income, but you can pay in installments). The Official Receiver will not look at your application until you have paid in full.<br />\nWe will give you produce a barcoded letter to take to your local Post Office or Payzone outlet &#8211; we recommend that you pay the fee in full before submitting your application.</p>\n<p>If you can’t afford the fee, you might be able to apply to a charity for help.</p>\n<h2>What happens next</h2>\n<p>The Official Receiver will ask a credit reference agency for information about your credit file and check the details in your application before making a decision.</p>\n<p>They will write to you to confirm you have been granted a DRO. They will also write to all the creditors listed in your application. Your creditors can object to the DRO being made, to being included in the DRO or to the details<br />\nof the debt as listed in the DRO, but only if they have valid grounds (for example if you are not eligible for a DRO). They can’t object just because they don’t want to be included in the order.</p>\n<h3>If your DRO stands</h3>\n<p>The qualifying debts listed on your DRO will be put on hold for 12 months. This is called the ‘moratorium period’. You will not usually need to make any further payments on these debts.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions to this rule &#8211; for example in some situations if you have rent arrears. Contact the Debt Advice Team for advice.</p>\n<p>If a creditor included in your application asks you to make a payment you should tell them about your DRO and let the Official Receiver know.</p>\n<h3>If your application is rejected</h3>\n<p>The Official Receiver will tell you and your approved intermediary the reasons.</p>\n<h3>Co-operating with the Official Receiver</h3>\n<p>It is very important that you cooperate with the Official Receiver throughout the DRO process.</p>\n<p>You must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the Official Receiver if any of your circumstances change (including change of address) during the 12 months from the date you are granted a DRO.</li>\n<li>Give information about your finances to the Official Receiver if they ask.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have provided a full list of your debts and assets.</li>\n<li>Tell the Official Receiver if your income increases, or if you come into any money or property during the 12 months from the date you are granted a DRO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cancelling a DRO</h2>\n<p>Your DRO may be cancelled (revoked) if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Official Receiver finds out that the information you provided about your income, assets and debts was inaccurate &#8211; they may also take criminal or civil action against you or</li>\n<li>your circumstances change so much during the moratorium period that you no longer meet the qualifying criteria</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How will a DRO affect me?</h2>\n<h3>If your DRO is approved:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You will have certain debt relief restrictions placed on you – for example:\n<ul>\n<li>You will have to tell your lender you have a DRO if you apply to take out credit of more than £500 and/or</li>\n<li>You will have to tell everyone you do business with the name you used for your DRO if you run a business in a different name and/or</li>\n<li>You won’t be allowed to get involved with the promotion, management or formation of a limited company or become a company director without permission from the court and/or</li>\n<li>You won’t be allowed to hold certain public office and/or</li>\n<li>You won’t be able to apply for a further DRO for six years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your bank or building society may decide to freeze your bank account – especially if you have debt with them. Check with your bank/building society to see if this is a risk. You can open a new basic bank or building society account – but it is up to the bank/building society to decide if they will let you do this</li>\n<li>Your DRO will be recorded on your credit reference file and will be kept for six years. This will affect your ability to get a mortgage in the future because, even after six years, some lenders may ask if you have ever been made bankrupt or had a DRO.</li>\n<li>Your DRO will be recorded on the individual insolvency register (a public register) for 15 months (the duration of your DRO lasts plus 3 months).</li>\n<li>Your job may be at risk if your contract of employment states that you are not allowed to have a DRO.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Properties built after the mid 1980s are unlikely to contain asbestos.</p>\n<h2>Why asbestos is dangerous</h2>\n<p>When asbestos is damaged, the fibres can be released into the air. If these fibres are breathed in, they can cause lung diseases. People who have worked with asbestos, or had contact with someone who worked with asbestos, are most likely to be affected.</p>\n<p>Asbestos cement products are considered relatively low risk and are unlikely to release high level of fibres unless they are damaged by extreme abrasion or drilling.</p>\n<h2>Where asbestos is found</h2>\n<p>Building materials containing asbestos were widely used from 1930 to 1980. Houses and flats built during this time might contain it. It is not easy to tell whether a product contains asbestos just by looking.</p>\n<p>In the home asbestos may be found in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>insulating board &#8211; particularly common in 1960s and 1970s housing</li>\n<li>lagging &#8211; widely used in public buildings and flats built in the 1960s and 1970s, usually found in boiler rooms and heating plants</li>\n<li>sprayed coating &#8211; used for fire protection of structural steel during the 1960s, mainly used in service ducts or lift shafts</li>\n<li>asbestos cement products &#8211; found in many types of building as flat sheets for roofing and cladding, often used for garages and sheds</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What to do if you suspect you have asbestos in your home</h2>\n<p>If asbestos is in good condition and not likely to be damaged, you do not need to remove them. To do so would lead to fibres in the air. If you are planning improvements to your home, you should inform contractors of the suspected or actual presence of asbestos. </p>\n<p>Do not carry out DIY work on sprayed asbestos, lagging or insulating boards &#8211; this must be done by a licensed asbestos removal contractor. </p>\n<p>Precautions you should take when working with other asbestos materials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wear protective overalls (disposable overalls that can be thrown away afterwards)</li>\n<li>wear a disposable face mask (&#8216;CE&#8217; marked to EN 149 standard with FFP2 filters)</li>\n<li>keep the asbestos material wet to reduce the amount of dust produced</li>\n<li>work outside if possible</li>\n<li>do not let other people in the work area</li>\n<li>do not drill, cut or disturb the asbestos</li>\n<li>use hand tools rather than power tools</li>\n<li>use an industrial vacuum cleaner to clear the dust (to standard BS 5415 (Type H))</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removing asbestos</h2>\n<p>Asbestos materials that are badly damaged can release dust and should be removed. Some materials high in asbestos content, such as sprayed asbestos, lagging or insulating boards, must be removed by contractors with special licences. </p>\n<p>There is a special area at the recycling centre (tip) for the disposal of asbestos cement. You must contact the centre before taking asbestos there. Small amounts of wast should be wetted and placed in a strong plastic bag for disposal. Large asbestos cement sheets should not be broken up. They should be wrapped in polythene and disposed as asbestos waste. </p>\n<p>Asbestos materials should never be put in as ordinary domestic waste.</p>\n<p>The property owner is responsible for the safe disposal of asbestos.

    "content": "<p>Dampness can occur in homes for many reasons. It can lead to mould and mites, problems keeping your home warm and damage to the building.</p>\n<h3>Causes of damp</h3>\n<p>There are many causes of damp, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leaking pipes and overflows</li>\n<li>rain water entering through holes in the roof</li>\n<li>blocked or damaged guttering</li>\n<li>rising damp caused by a defective or missing damp course</li>\n<li>gaps in the external walls or around the windows</li>\n<li>in newly built homes, water used in construction may still be drying out</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These problems often leave a tide mark or coloured stains. The cause of the damp should be repaired as soon as possible. You will then need to dry the dampness out.</p>\n<p>If you see black mould growing this is likely to be caused by condensation.</p>\n<h3>Condensation</h3>\n<p>When air gets colder it holds less moisture and this makes tiny drops of water form. Condensation usually happens in cold weather on both wet and dry days. It occurs on cold surfaces and in areas with little air movement. Signs of condensation include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>water forming on windows</li>\n<li>mould growth on window frames</li>\n<li>damp and mould forming on external walls</li>\n<li>mould forming in areas behind large pieces of furniture</li>\n<li>mouldy clothes</li>\n<li>mould growing in corners of rooms and where walls and ceilings meet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also a type of condensation called interstitial condensation. This happens when warm, moist air soaks into a wall, ceiling or floor before hitting a cold surface within. The air quickly cools and water is left as dampness on the surface. This can look like rising damp. Interstitial condensation can lead to rot and corrosion.</p>\n<h4>Avoiding condensation</h4>\n<p>Produce less moisture by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drying washing outside &#8211; if you need to dry clothes indoors, do it this in the bathroom with the extractor fan on or a window open</li>\n<li>venting non-condenser tumble dryers to the outside</li>\n<li>opening the window to allow moist air to escape after a bath or shower</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also important to ventilate your home without causing draughts.

People sleep rough in Reading for various economic, local and individual reasons. This strategy explores these reasons and acknowledges that no single factor is responsible; that they are not exhaustive<br />\nor mutually exclusive, neither are individuals exonerated from their own action or inaction.</p>\n<p>Many people sleeping rough will experience different combinations of issues at times in their lives which result in them sleeping rough. Where there is no single reason for its cause, there is no single resolution.</p>\n<p>Rough sleeping numbers increased year-on year, both nationally and in Reading, between 2010 and 2017. In 2018, there was a decrease. In Reading this was by 19% from 31 down to 25; nationally this was by 2% from 4751 down to 4677. A reduction in numbers is positive, but Reading will continue to utilise Council<br />\nfunded outreach and accommodation services and monies successfully obtained through bids to the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government’s (MHCLG) Rough Sleeping<br />\nInitiative and Rapid Rehousing Pathway funds.</p>\n<p>The following principles will underpin the strategy’s delivery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowing there is a long-term, sustainable option for anyone sleeping rough</li>\n<li>Innovation: Creative responses and making the most of existing resources</li>\n<li>Strategic local leadership: Accountability and cross-borough working</li>\n<li>Partnership working: Everyone having an<br />\nimportant role</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The strategy’s key objective is to reduce rough sleeping by half, to 15 individuals or fewer, by 2022 and to eliminate it entirely by 2027 in line with central government targets.</p>\n<h2>The Council’s strategic priorities around rough sleeping are:</h2>\n<h3>Priority 1: Early intervention and prevention</h3>\n<p>To prevent those who are vulnerable to sleeping rough from moving towards entrenched and harmful behaviours and<br />\nlifestyles by intervening as early as possible.</p>\n<h3>Priority 2: Recovery and community integration</h3>\n<p>To ensure that recovery underpins tenancy sustainment as part of a holistic approach to homelessness prevention.</p>\n<h3>Priority 3: Rapid intervention</h3>\n<p>To intervene rapidly when prevention has been ineffective and homelessness is unavoidable.</p>\n<h3>Priority 4: United support and enforcement action in Reading</h3>\n<p>To approach rough sleeping in a way that supports individuals, but that also protects Reading’s resident and business community<br />\nfrom the effects of any associated anti-social behaviours.</p>\n<h3>Priority 5: Provision of information and alternative ways to give</h3>\n<p>To provide steer to our local communities in how they respond to people who are sleeping rough by providing sufficient and accessible information, support and guidance around how we collectively and individually support vulnerable people</p>\n<p>Download the full <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Rough_Sleeping_Strategy_2019_-_2024_FINAL.pdf\">Rough Sleeping Strategy 2019 &#8211; 2024</a>.</p>\n",

The aim of the Covenant is to encourage all parties within a community to offer support to the local Armed Forces community &#8211; including veterans &#8211; and make it easier for services personnel, families<br />\nand veterans to access the help and support available.</p>\n<h2>Before you leave the forces</h2>\n<p>If you are likely to need advice and assistance to find accommodation you should contact the Homeless Prevention Service straightaway.</p>\n<p>We will assess your situation and give you advice on your options so you can make an informed decision about your housing.</p>\n<p>Six months before you leave the forces, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) will give you a Certificate of Cessation of Entitlement with the date that you will stop being entitled to forces accommodation. You should give this to the Homeless Prevention Service as soon as it is issued.</p>\n<h3>Joint Service Housing Advice Office (JSHAO)</h3>\n<p>You can also contact the JSHAO for advice on your civilian housing options at any time during your career. Call 01252 787574 or attend one of their civilian housing options briefs delivered across the UK, Germany and Cyprus each year.</p>\n<p>The JSHAO also runs the MOD referral scheme which may help you to find a housing association home. You can apply if you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>married or a separated spouse still in services family accommodation (SFA)</li>\n<li>single and living in a hostel within 6 months of leaving the forces</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>If you are homeless or at risk of homelessness</h2>\n<p>If you have already left the armed forces and are homeless or threatened with homelessness you should immediately get in touch with the Homeless Prevention Service. We will assess your situation and work with you to create a personalised housing plan which will include your housing options.</p>\n<p>As someone who has been in the armed forces you may be entitled to emergency accommodation. Emergency accommodation can be provided if we assess you as being in priority need. You will normally have a priority need if you, or someone in your household:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is pregnant</li>\n<li>has dependent children who normally live with you</li>\n<li>has been made homeless by an emergency such as flood or fire</li>\n<li>is vulnerable as a result of any physical/mental conditions, a learning disability or due to your time spent and experiences of the armed forces</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your housing options</h2>\n<p>We will discuss options that are appropriate for you and your household. The demand for all forms of housing in Reading is very high therefore you should explore all the housing options which are available to you.</p>\n<p>Your options may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Looking for <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/private-renting/\">private rented accommodation</a> &#8211; you should consider the size and type of accommodation you need for your household and how much rent you can afford. Most landlords will ask for a cash deposit (in case you fail to pay your rent or cause damage to their<br />\nproperty). If you don&#8217;t have a deposit we may be able to help either through the Rent Guarantee Scheme or by lending you the money to pay a cash deposit direct to your landlord.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/rent-guarantee-scheme-rgs/\">Rent Guarantee Scheme</a> (RGS) &#8211; this scheme helps households on low incomes into private rented accommodation. We pay the rent to your landlord and provide a deposit guarantee (instead of a cash deposit). The scheme removes the needs for a guarantor because the Council guarantee the rent to the landlord for the duration of the tenancy. You must pay your rent to us and save for your own deposit.</li>\n<li>Applying to <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/find-a-home/register-for-housing/\">Homechoice</a> (Reading’s Housing Register) so you can bid for a Council or Housing Association home. As a member of the armed forces you don’t need a “local connection” which requires you to<br />\nhave lived in the Borough for the three years before you apply. You may also qualify for an “additional preference” which could give you higher priority for rehousing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Help with housing costs</h2>\n<p>If you are working and on a low income or if you claim welfare benefits you may be eligible for <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/housing-benefit-and-council-tax-support/\">Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support</a> or <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/discretionary-housing-council-tax-support-payments/universal-credit/\">Universal Credit</a> to help towards your rent.</p>\n<h3>The Local Housing Allowance (LHA)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-housing-allowance\">LHA</a> limits the amount of benefit/credit you could get towards your rent based on the number of bedrooms your household is eligible for. You can ask for these payments to go directly to your landlord.</p>\n<h2>What other help could I get as a veteran?</h2>\n<h3>Veteran’s Housing Advice</h3>\n<p>This organisation is provided in partnership with The Royal British Legion, Shelter and Connect Assist.

    "title": "Allocations &#8211; full scheme",
    "content": "\n\n\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of this scheme is to issue guidance relating to the allocation of social housing within the Borough of Reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council owns homes across Reading and has nomination rights to Registered Providers’ (Housing Association) homes. In acting as a good landlord and as an enabling Local Authority, the Council is committed to managing and letting social housing in a fair and transparent way to assist households with a need for accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scheme has been developed in partnership with Registered Providers and other interested parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scheme will enable the Council to encourage choice and give capacity to those households eligible for housing who want to engage and be involved in housing decisions that affect their future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, applicants need to have a realistic expectation of the assistance that the Council can provide under its Allocations Scheme. The demand for social housing outstrips the supply and, historically, only a small proportion of applicants are re-housed through the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management of the Allocations Scheme and Information</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Allocations Scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Section 167 Housing Act 1996 places a duty on every local housing authority to prepare and maintain a set of rules which it has adopted, determining the authority’s priorities and procedure to be followed in allocating housing accommodation. This statement is intended to meet that requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scheme sets out those applicants who Reading Borough Council has decided are a qualifying class of person who can join the Housing Register and those applicants who are considered a non-qualifying class of person who will not be able to access the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme also sets out the criteria against which qualifying applicants are considered in relation to reasonable preference and additional preference categories. It also identifies reasons when individual applicants, who may have a reasonable or additional preference, could be considered to have No Priority for Housing depending on their circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full scheme will be made available to inspect at the Civic Offices or on the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/allocationsscheme\">www.reading.gov.uk/allocationsscheme</a>. A summary of the scheme can also be provided on request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consultation will be carried when any major changes made to the content of the scheme are proposed, to ensure that those affected have input. This will include consultation with Registered Providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Head of Housing and Neighbourhoods is the lead officer with delegated authority to allocate housing accommodation under Part VI of the Housing Act 1996.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering exceptional circumstances, decision will be made by the Housing Needs Manager. This will be considered following a request from either an applicant or a member of staff. These decision will be recorded and reasons provided to evidence the outcome of the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Elected members&#8217; involvement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Allocation of Housing (Procedure) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/483) prevent an elected member from being part of a decision-making body at the time an allocation decision is made, when either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The accommodation concerned is situated in their division or electoral ward, or</li><li>The person subject to the decision has their sole or main residence</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not prevent an elected member from representing their constituents in front of the decision-making body or from participating in the decision-making body’s deliberations prior to its decision. The regulations also do not prevent elected&nbsp; members’ involvement in policy decisions that affect the generality of housing accommodation in their division or electoral ward rather than individual allocations; for example, a decision that certain types of properties should be prioritised for older people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What we do with Personal Information</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any information provided by an applicant will <em>only </em>be used and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The information will be used to process an application for housing, develop our business and provide statistical information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information given by the applicant, in support of his/her request for housing may be cross checked against other information held about him/her within the Council. We will notify offender managers regarding the appropriateness of accommodation offered to prison leavers or ex-offenders who have disclosed information regarding their offending backgrounds. Equally, if a registration form or home visit raises either Child Protection or Vulnerable Adult concerns, then Reading Borough Council may refer to either Children’s or Adult Services regarding these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information held may also be shared with other housing and/or care providers to ensure a suitable and successful allocation of housing. This information will be shared with consent from the applicant, provided on the Homechoice Registration Form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council may also contact agencies for information relevant to assessing the application. This may include, for example: the Home Office in relation to an applicant’s asylum status, current and previous landlords or mortgage companies and support agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An applicant will, on request, be shown and be given personal information relating to their application in line with a ‘Subject Access’ request under the Data Protection Act. Information will not be disclosed to third parties unless there is a valid request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Furthermore, information that has been provided</p>\n\n\n\n<p>by a third party will not be disclosed to the applicant. For example, where a GP has provided medical information regarding the applicant to the local authority, this information would not be disclosed to the applicant unless the GP agreed to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Statement of Fair Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with the Data Protection Act 1988, we will process applicants’ information for the purpose of assessing housing need, collecting statistical information and to improve our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may also use this information to detect and prevent fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal information will be stored electronically and this will comply with our Data Protection policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full details of our Fair Processing Notice can be found on the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/dataprotection/data-protection-housing/\">www.reading.gov.uk/council/dataprotection/data-protection-housing/</a>Statement of the Scope of Applicants’ Choice</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Reading, the demand for Council and Registered Provider accommodation outstrips the level of supply. This means that the Council is not in a position to offer such accommodation to everyone on the Housing Register who expresses an interest and so, broadly speaking, offers of accommodation will be made to those applicants who have the highest priority for housing under the Allocations Scheme. In addition, this means that the primary aim of the scheme is to house those with the greatest housing need. In order to meet this aim the Allocations Scheme underpins the element of choice by allowing an applicant to express their interest in properties that are advertised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who are considered qualifying persons on the Housing Register will be placed in a priority band according to their housing circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Staff Applying For Social Housing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council staff applying for housing, particularly those working in the Housing Service, will need to make it known to a senior member of staff that they intend to apply for social housing and must complete the Declaration of Interest part of the form. This will ensure that the application process is transparent and confidentiality rules are followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legislation, Policy and Guidance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This document makes reference to the legal requirements and policies that must be adhered to. We have had regard to legislation including (but not limited to) the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Housing Act 1996, Part VI and VII as amended</li><li>Localism Act 2011</li><li>Tenancy Strategy 2013 &#8211; 2018</li><li>Homelessness Act 2002</li><li>Children Act 1989</li><li>Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 (c.49) and 1999 (c.33) and 2002</li><li>Section 19 Freedom of Information Act 2000</li><li>Equality Act 2010</li><li>Human Rights Act 1998</li><li>Data Protection Act 1998 as amended</li><li>Section 17 Children Act 1989</li><li>Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Act 2013</li><li>Housing &amp; Regeneration Act 2008</li><li>Allocation of   Housing  (Qualification  Criteria   for   Right   to   Move)(England) Regulations 2015 (SI2015/967)</li><li>The Allocation of Housing (Qualification Criteria for Armed Forces)(England) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1869) </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme has regard to the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) guidance, the most recent of which being:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Allocation of accommodation: guidance for local housing authorities in England (June 2012)</li><li>Providing social housing for local people Code of guidance (December 2013)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme has been developed with regard Reading Borough Council’s own Strategy and Policy, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Homelessness Strategy 2008-2013</li><li>Tenancy Strategy 2013</li><li>Housing Strategy : Firm Foundations – 2009 &#8211; 2014</li><li>Housing Adaptations Policy February 2011</li><li>Name Change Policy 2015</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud (Offences)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>S.171 Housing Act 1996 makes it an offence for anyone, in connection with the exercise by a housing authority of its functions under Part VI:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To knowingly give false information</li><li>To knowingly withhold relevant information which the housing authority has reasonably required the applicant to give in connection with the exercise of those functions.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The circumstances in which an offence is committed could include providing false information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On an application form for social housing</li><li>In response to a request for further information in support of the application</li><li>During a review proceeding</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This may include any applicant who fails to notify the Council of any relevant change in their circumstances which may affect their application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any applicant found guilty of such an offence will be liable to a fine, which could currently be as much as £5000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ground 5 in Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985 (as amended by s.146 of the 1996 Act) enables the Council to take action to repossess any tenancy obtained by the provision of false information or by the withholding of relevant information, by the tenant or a person acting at the tenant’s instigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Act 2013 identifies tenant fraud as a criminal matter and local authorities have the power to prosecute those who unlawfully sublet their social housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equality and Diversity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council promotes equal opportunities and, in doing so, has developed an equalities plan to underpin equality and diversity in all services that we provide. In line with the provisions of the Equality Act 2010, Reading Borough Council will:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of different</li><li>Promote equality between different groups and have due regard to the needs of these</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our aim is to continue to maintain equality and ensure that we let our homes in a non- discriminatory way based on meeting housing need. We also anticipate that the transparency of this will not let any customers be treated less favourably on the grounds of gender, marital status, pregnancy and maternity, race, disability, sexual orientation, age, faith or gender reassignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council Housing teams will treat all applications for housing in a sensitive and supportive manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Travelling Families</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a duty for local authorities to complete regular assessments of the accommodation needs of Travelling Families living in their area as they do for the rest of the community. Travelling Families will be assessed within the parameters of the housing scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scheme Aims</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main aims of Reading Borough Council’s Allocations Scheme are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To let social housing to households with the greatest need for accommodation</li><li>To let homes in a transparent, applicant-friendly and fair way, ensuring that existing and new applicants are treated equally</li><li>To meet the statutory and legal requirements for allocating social housing</li><li> To produce a scheme that is easy to understand, applicant focussed and is part of the delivery of an excellent housing service</li><li>To make sure that the Allocations Scheme is maximising the use of all social housing provided locally and sub-regionally.</li><li>To ensure that the Allocations Scheme minimises the void turnaround time of void properties</li><li>To make sure that the housing needs of vulnerable applicants and those in priority need are given reasonable preference</li><li>To encourage partnership working with other housing providers</li><li>To promote, create and establish balanced and sustainable communities. To make sure that the use of Choice Based Lettings (CBL) allows applicants to exercise greater control over their choice of housing, increasing the likelihood that tenancies will be sustained</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to help achieve these aims the Council will maintain a Housing Register. This is a list of people registered for housing who are prioritised according to their level of housing need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of an Allocation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council’s Allocations Scheme sets out how social rented housing is allocated to those registered on the Housing Register. Section 159 of the Housing Act 1996 (Part VI) defines an allocation of social housing as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Selecting a&nbsp;&nbsp; person&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; secure&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; introductory&nbsp; tenant&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; housing accommodation held by this authority;</li><li>Nominating a person to be a secure or introductory tenant of housing accommodation held by another housing authority (i.e. one of the authorities or bodies fulfilling the landlord condition mentioned in the Housing Act 1985, s.80) or</li><li>Nominating a person to be an assured tenant of housing accommodation held by a Private Registered</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are not allocations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Transfers of accommodation, unless made at the tenant’s own request</li><li>Family Intervention Tenancies as defined in section 297 of the Housing &amp; Regeneration Act 2008</li><li>Successions</li><li>Assignments</li><li>Property Adjustment Orders</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Any change to an existing tenancy, such as changes to those named on a tenancy agreement, will involve Reading Borough Council offering a new allocation and tenancy agreement, as per the Name Change Policy. This will be carried out outside of the Choice Based Lettings Scheme however the Qualification Criteria will be applied to any  new named tenant. Any agreement to change a current agreement will be made by Reading Borough Council. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview of Choice Based Lettings and Housing Register (operational)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council will hold a Housing Register of qualifying people who wish to apply for accommodation with Reading Borough Council and/or Registered Provider accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On processing all Homechoice Registration Forms that are completed and received, Reading Borough Council will assess the priority and award a band to reflect this (see section 17). Once registered, applicants are then able to register interest in properties that Reading Borough Council advertises, this is known as “bidding” (see section 10.2).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process for Housing Register</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council’s Housing Register is a list of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First time applicants (including those to whom the Council owes a main duty under the Homelessness legislation) for a Council and/or Registered Provider property. Referred to as Homeseeker</li><li>Council and Registered Provider tenants wishing to transfer to other accommodation. Referred to as Transfer</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants must complete a Housing Registration Form and sign the consent section of the form. This gives permission for Reading Borough Council to obtain any relevant information that is required to assist the housing registration process. Applicants who are unable to read or write, or who want assistance in completing the forms, can request an appointment to see a member of staff in the Councils’ offices or at their home, or can be directed towards other agencies that may be able to assist them in applying for housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants must also supply a passport sized photograph of themselves and their partner, along with rent account information if they are a Registered Provider tenant and equity information (the amount gained from a sale of property) if they have previously owned a property. Reading Borough Council may also request proof that the applicant is a qualifying person at this stage (see section 14).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the Homechoice Registration Form has been processed the application is assessed against the qualification and eligibility criteria to ensure that the applicant qualifies and is eligible to register for social housing (see sections 13 and 14).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once eligibility and qualification criteria are satisfied, Reading Borough Council will assess the application for priority based on housing need (see section 17).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicant will receive an acknowledgement letter giving details of the following information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Confirmation of whether qualifying criteria have been satisfied</li><li> Personal Identification number (PIN) – a unique reference number</li><li>Details of the initial band in which their registration has been placed (see Appendix 1)</li><li>Confirmation of the date of application</li><li>Details of the size of property for which the applicant has been registered</li><li>Details of how to obtain further information about the Allocations Scheme</li><li>A Homechoice at Reading user guide </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments of applications to the Housing Register will be subject to a thorough investigation of all the circumstances. As part of the investigation Reading Borough Council may carry out home visits, contact third party agencies (including voluntary sector partners) and will collect evidence where appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any decision not to place someone on to the Housing Register (due to ineligibility or non- qualification), to amend an application on the register, or to remove someone from the register, will be notified to the applicant in writing. Reasons for the decision will be provided and the applicant will be informed of their right to request a review of the decision made within 21 days (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All customers can enquire online regarding their status on the Housing Register on the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice\">www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Annual Re-registration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All Housing Register applicants (including Transfers) are required to re-register annually. Applicants will receive a new Homechoice Registration Form to complete in order to confirm or update previously submitted information; this is to ensure the Housing Register holds accurate information relating to of each applicant’s&nbsp; circumstances.&nbsp; Those applicants that fail to respond within 28 days will be removed from the register.&nbsp; A request for a review of the decision to remove an application can be made (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Change of Circumstances</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All applicants are required to notify the Voids and Lettings Team immediately of any change to their circumstances which may affect their priority for re-housing, for example a change of address, someone joining or leaving their household, the acquisition of property, etc. This may also affect their eligibility or qualification to join the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicant will be notified in writing of any change in their priority for re-housing. When an applicant’s change of circumstances has been assessed, this may result in a change in the applicant’s band. The applicant’s new level of priority will run from the date upon which they informed the Voids and Lettings Team of the change of circumstances, and not from the date of the original application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A change of circumstance may be considered at any stage of the application process, from initial application to receiving a formal offer and may be identified by an officer, for example at a home visit. A change in an applicant’s situation may result in a</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reduction in priority for housing at any stage prior to the commencement of a new tenancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Council has been made aware of a change of circumstances but has not received updated information regarding the change, such as a completed Homechoice Registration Form, the applicant’s band will be reduced until such time as the Homechoice Registration Form has been received and processed (see section 18). This may lead to any successful bid being disregarded, and potentially the removal of any formal offer of accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Process for Homechoice at Reading (Choice Based Lettings)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council advertises properties and applicants are required to bid for those that they are interested in. The bidder who has been assessed as having the greatest need or ‘highest priority’ (see section 17) will be offered the property, provided it is suitable for their needs. When considering suitability of a property Reading Borough Council takes into account whether the physical attributes of the property (factors such as size of the property or access to the property) will meet the needs of the applicant (which could include, but is not limited to, number of household members and mobility limitations).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please be aware that allocation to properties managed by Registered Providers will be subject to their own procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adverts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All adverts will usually include the following information regarding the property:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Type of tenancy offered</li><li>Landlord</li><li>Location</li><li>Type (flat, bungalow )</li><li>Size (number of bedrooms)</li><li>Floor and whether or not it has a lift</li><li>Local amenities</li><li>Type of heating</li><li>Whether it has a garden</li><li>The amount of rent payable</li><li>Whether it is specialist accommodation, such as purpose built for wheelchair users, Supported Accommodation, Sheltered Accommodation or Elderly Designated Stock, i.e. properties that are only accessible for those over a certain age.</li><li>If the property is subject to a Local Lettings policy (see section 3).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council properties and Registered Provider properties will be advertised fortnightly on the Council website and in a free sheet which will be available in public resource centres such as Libraries, Neighbourhood Advice Shops and Council</p>\n\n\n\n<p>offices. Any change to the bidding cycle will be subject to review at any time in consultation with relevant parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adverts will be monitored to ensure that quota queues are met (see section 21). At times, advertisements may be restricted to particular quota queues to ensure that all groups are encouraged to participate in Homechoice at Reading. This is to assist in the development of community cohesion and stability within neighbourhoods. In some circumstances adverts will be limited to specific applicants. This will be to ensure that the Council is making best use of its stock, particularly where there are large sized family units.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bidding</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants can bid in the following ways (further information can be obtained from the Homechoice User Guide or the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice)\">www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice):</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>by telephone</li><li>online through the Reading Borough Council website</li><li>by text</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants can request assistance from the Council for support with the bidding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will have 7 days to place a bid and will be notified of the closing date for bidding on the advert sheet. Applicants will be able to bid for up to 3 properties per cycle. If an applicant is successful on more than 1 property in the same cycle they will be asked which property they would prefer to be considered for and any other bid will be disregarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sanction for those who refuse 3 offers of suitable accommodation within a 6 month period (see section 24.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those applicants who have been given additional priority as they are considered to be homeless or at risk of violence different rules may apply (see sections 23 and 24).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Registered Providers will manage the bids placed for accommodation that they advertise in partnership with Reading Borough Council, in line with the Council’s Allocations Scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bids will be evaluated to check whether:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There have been any changes in circumstances since the date of application (this may result in an applicant’s priority changing and the bid being disregarded) and</li><li>The successful bidder is eligible<a href=\"#_bookmark0\"><sup>1</sup> </a>for re-housing</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Council believes, through advice and consultation with other statutory agencies, that a bid for accommodation to a particular area could present an unreasonable risk to surrounding residents/tenants or to the applicant, then the Council</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1 Eligible – checks will be made to establish identification, immigration status and address before any offer is made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>will reserve the right to not consider the bid for that particular property. However, the household may continue to place bids for other accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If bidding is unsuccessful, applicants will not be directly notified, rather Reading Borough Council will publish feedback information on successful bids in the previous cycle in each edition of the free sheet and on the Council website. This will include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The number of bids for each property</li><li>The priority band of the successful applicant</li><li>The length of time the successful applicant has been registered for housing in that band</li><li>The applicant type, as Transfer or Homeseeker</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This information will help to inform applicants how frequently certain types of property become available, and the indicative waiting time per area.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Viewing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When applicants have been successful in their bid they will be contacted to view the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to reduce the amount of time a property is left vacant for, an applicant may be expected to view a property with as little as 24 hours’ notice. However more notice will be given where possible. Applicants will receive a formal invitation to view a property with a date and time to attend the property, this may be arranged via a telephone call. If the applicant fails to attend the viewing or respond to the invitation Reading Borough Council will overlook the bid for that property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the majority of cases the top 3 bidders will be offered a viewing of the property and asked to state whether they would accept an offer of the accommodation. An offer will be made to the applicant that has been assessed as having the greatest need (see section 10.4).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will be expected to confirm if they wish to accept the property within 24 hours of the viewing, before being made a formal offer of accommodation. Failure to respond within the time scale may result in the bid being disregarded and the property being offered to the next applicant in priority order.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Offers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If several applicants who are in the same priority band place bids for the same property, the applicant who has waited the longest within the band will be offered the accommodation. If they have been waiting the same length of time in the priority band the property will be offered to the applicant with the earliest date of registration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before a formal offer is made Reading Borough Council will verify the information provided in the Homechoice Registration Form.&nbsp; For verification purposes, applicants&nbsp; will be required to provide specific information such as, but not limited to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Proof of eligibility (see section 13)</li><li> Identification</li><li>Proof of address</li><li>Proof of income </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants are required to supply this information to the Civic Offices within 24 hours of the viewing. If applicants do not provide this information within the time scales, a formal offer will not be made and their bid may be disregarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are any exceptional circumstances that mean that applicants are unable to provide the information requested within 24 hours of the viewing, an extended time can be agreed with the Voids and Lettings Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once all relevant information has been verified a letter will be sent advising the applicant of their offer of accommodation. A date will be arranged for them to sign the Tenancy Agreement at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant refuses the offer or does not provide verification information, the applicant with the next highest level of priority who has viewed the accommodation will be made an offer, for which the verification process will also apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All applicants will become non qualifying persons (see section 14.1) from the date that they receive a formal offer of a Part VI Allocation. If they later refuse the property&nbsp; their application will be reinstated from their registration date and their band restored from their effective date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be occasions when Reading Borough Council will have to remove a property from the shortlisting process. This will only happen in exceptional circumstances, for example, where the Council requires a specific property to help satisfy a legal responsibility. Reading Borough Council will aim to avoid removing properties after they have been advertised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenancy types</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of this section a “secure tenant” includes a person with a flexible tenancy granted under s.107A of the Housing Act 1985 (inserted by s.154 of the Localism Act 2011). The term “assured tenant” includes a person with an assured short-hold tenancy, including an Affordable Rent Property (Affordable Rent, which is assessed at no more than 80% of the local market rent, is not subject to the national rent regime but is subject to other rent controls that require a rent, including service charges).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When allocating accommodation to applicants from the Housing Register, Reading Borough Council will always offer an introductory tenancy (a minimum of 12 months) to those who have not previously been a permanent Reading Borough Council tenant, or a secure tenancy to those who are transferring within our stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the introduction of the Localism Act 2011, many Registered Providers have introduced fixed term/flexible tenancies which are for a certain period of time, normally between 2 – 7 years. These tenancies are also allocated via the Housing Register and, as above, are subject to an introductory period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered Providers are able to offer properties at a different rent level, known as Affordable Rent. This will typically be 80% of market rent. Applicants need to be aware when they are bidding for accommodation if this will be affordable for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More detail on Reading Borough Council’s expectations on how Registered Providers manage flexible tenancies and Affordable Rent is available in Reading Borough Council’s Tenancy Strategy at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/Housing\">www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/Housing</a> StrategiesandPlans/tenancy-strategy-2013-2018/.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For applicants currently in a secure or assured tenancy and are considering bidding for accommodation with an Affordable Rent or flexible tenancy, it is important to understand the implications on any future tenancy. Please see the following guide:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<strong>Current Tenancy Type</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>The Current Tenancy Start</strong>\n<strong>Date</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Rent on New Property</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Tenancy Entitled to</strong>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\nBefore 1/4/ 2012\n</td><td>\nSocial Rent\n</td><td>\nSecure/Assured\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n&nbsp;\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nBefore 1/4/2012\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAffordable Rent\n</td><td>\nAssured/Secure or Fixed Term (if this is what is being offered)\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n&nbsp;\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAfter 1/4/2012\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nSocial Rent\n</td><td>\nAssured/Secure or Fixed\nTerm (if this is what is being offered)\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n&nbsp;\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAfter 1/4/2012\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAffordable Rent\n</td><td>\nAssured/Secure or Fixed\nTerm (if this is what is being offered)\n</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Family Intervention Tenancy (FIT)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a non-secure tenancy within Reading Borough Council or Registered Provider accommodation which may be offered to those with complex needs. Those families considered for a FIT will be assessed and agreed in partnership with Social Care and other appropriate agencies. The FIT will generally be for a fixed period of time with conditions attached, such as, engagement with relevant agencies and support. They have limited security of tenure, and as such they will be terminable on notice with no need to prove any ground for termination or possession. The aim is to allow households to be supported in order to achieve independence. On the successful completion of a&nbsp; FIT a direct offer may be made to the property being occupied (see section 22).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing Needs Groups</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 2 main groups of applicants on the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Transfer Applicants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Transfer applicants comprise of Reading Borough Council and Registered Provider tenants who register with the Council for alternative social housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Homeseekers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeseekers comprise of first time applicants, homeless applicants owed duties in accordance with the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII) as amended, or those who are not existing Council or Registered Provider tenants. This group could comprise of people living in the private rented sector or with friends and/or family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is not eligible for an Allocation of Accommodation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council Allocations Scheme is framed according to relevant legislation and good practice. Section 160ZA Housing Act 1996 as amended states that the Council shall not allocate housing accommodation to the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People who are subject to immigration control within the meaning of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 unless he or she is of a class prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State or is already a secure or introductory tenant or an assured tenant of housing accommodation allocated to him by a local housing authority.</li><li>People who are excluded from entitlement to Housing Benefit by section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33) (exclusion from benefits).</li><li>Other classes of persons from abroad who are ineligible for an allocation of accommodation, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of</li><li>Applicants who are not deemed to be habitually resident in the CTA (Common Travel Area) or EEA (European Economic Area).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Eligibility can change with a change of immigration status; therefore, eligibility for an allocation of housing will be kept under review. However, the applicant is responsible for informing the Council of any change in immigration status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decisions of eligibility based on an applicant’s immigration status will be made by a Voids and Lettings Officer, who will take into account information from the Home Office or Border Agency, (or other appropriate government department) and apply relevant Legislation and statutory instruments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The registration of applicants on the Housing Register is not an acceptance by the Council that they are considered eligible for an allocation of accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Homechoice Registration Form includes an eligibility declaration confirming that applicants agree that Reading Borough Council neither agrees nor disagrees that they are eligible for assistance at the point of application. The Council may make a decision on eligibility at the stage of application or when verifying an application once a successful bid has been made. If the applicant is not accepted on to the Housing Register they will be advised of this in writing and given information on how to request a review of this decision (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will be asked to provide documentary evidence to prove eligibility for themselves and for all members of their household, at the point that they make a successful bid for accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant makes a successful bid for accommodation and is unable to provide documentation to prove eligibility of themselves and their household, s/he will not be allocated the accommodation and will be removed from the housing register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the proof of eligibility document shows that their eligibility for services was granted after their application date then their application date will be amended to the date that they became eligible which may result in an allocation not being made on that occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eligibility for an allocation of accommodation will only be confirmed at the point when Reading Borough Council has checked all relevant documentation, if required, and is satisfied as to the applicant and their household’s eligibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each case will be considered individually, taking account of all relevant circumstances. Applicants who successfully bid for accommodation but are deemed ineligible for an allocation of accommodation will be notified in writing of this decision. Applicants will have the right to request a review of this decision within 21 days of the decision date (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; considered&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualifying&nbsp; Person&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; Reading&nbsp; Borough Council’s Housing Register?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Localism Act 2011 introduces powers for Local Authorities to determine who will be allowed to register for accommodation locally. Applicants that satisfy any qualification criteria are known as Qualifying Persons. The following qualifying criteria apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have been resident in the borough for 3 consecutive years or more directly prior to the date of their application and are still resident in the Reading area at the point a successful bid is made will be considered to be Qualifying Persons on Reading Borough Council’s Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have not been resident in the borough for 3 consecutive years or more directly prior to the date of the application may also be considered to be Qualifying Persons provided they satisfy one or more of the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Worked in the borough for 3 consecutive years in permanent employment, directly prior to the date of their application and are still in permanent employment in the borough at the point a successful bid is made, regardless of number of hours per week. Location of work is determined by an applicant’s ‘main place of work’. If work placement is split across boroughs, the main place of work must be in the Reading area. If an employer’s head office is in the Reading area, but the location of work is outside the Reading area, the actual location where the work is carried out will be considered as the main place of work.</li><li>Family members who have lived in the borough for 3 years continuously directly prior to the date of their application and are still residing in the borough &#8211; close</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>relatives, being mother, father, sister, brother, children over 18. Other special relations such as grandparents who have acted as guardians may also be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Carers’ responsibilities to a resident in the Reading area &#8211; when there is an identified need for formal care for a person residing in the borough.

Reading Borough Council must be satisfied that there is a need to move rather than a wish and in making this assessment the Council will consider the personal circumstances of each applicant on their own\n<ul><li>This work or offer of work must be:\n<ul><li>Regular work for a minimum of 16 hours per week, this includes apprenticeships but does not include voluntary work;</li><li>A minimum of a 12 month contact at the point of application</li><li>The main place of work is in the Reading borough area</li><li>Unreasonable to access by transport taking into account, the nature of the transport, distance, time and</li></ul>\n</li><li>Any other exceptional circumstances, for example, intimidated witnesses including Protected Persons as specified in Section 82 and schedule 5 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>People who are not Qualifying Persons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The following classes of people are considered to be Non Qualifying Persons and therefore will not be included on the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Those applicants who are under 16 years of</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Those who do not meet the residence criteria as set out in the section</li><li>People who have been evicted from a social rented tenancy for tenancy management issues.

This will also include the behaviour of other members of the household. Any such applicant will be excluded for a period of between 1 and 3 years from the date that they apply. They are able to submit a new application after 1 year but the Council reserves the right to continue to treat them as a non-qualifying</li><li>Applicants who have refused 3 suitable properties within a 6 month period. Any such applicant cannot apply for a period of 1 year from the date of the last refusal (see section 1).</li><li>Introductory tenants requesting a transfer whilst they have an introductory tenancy. If there is an urgent need to move, then the Council may in some circumstances agree to the transfer. In these circumstances a further introductory tenancy will be offered for the remaining tenancy</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All Applicants will become non qualifying persons from the date that they receive a formal offer of a Part VI Allocation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they later refuse the property without requesting a review of its suitability, their application will be reinstated from their application date and their band restored from their effective date, as long as no sanctions apply (see section 24.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that a request is made to review the suitability of the accommodation offered under Part VI (see section 23.1) the applicant will remain as a non-qualifying person throughout the review process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In exceptional circumstances, the Council may choose not to apply the above criteria when considering an individual application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An applicant will need to reapply at the end of the period in which they are considered to be a non-qualifying person, or if their situation changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Transition to new scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The qualification rules set out above will apply to all new applications from the date of the publication of the new scheme 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016. We will write to all external applicants to advise them they will be removed unless there is an exception. For those who are living in the borough at the point of implementation who applied to join the Housing Register prior to 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016 the residency qualification criteria will not apply. We will re-register all applicants on the Housing Register prior&nbsp; to implementation. For applicants who have previous applied and that application was</p>\n\n\n\n<p>subsequently cancelled, any new application submitted to re-join the Housing Register after 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016 will be subject to the new criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those tenants who are introductory tenants at the time of the transition to the new scheme will be allowed to remain on the Housing Register, however, they will not be allocated other accommodation until their tenancy is secure. Those who have been found guilty of anti-social behaviour or who have been evicted previously due to a breach of tenancy in the social housing sector will be considered on a case by case basis, which could be at shortlist stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is considered to be part of the household including Joint Tenancies?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Who can be considered as part of the Household?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for the Council to decide who can be considered as part of the household, this will be done by considering whether a person is normally resident as a member of the family. When the Council considers requests for housing, it is likely that the following circumstances will be considered:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Partners who are living in a permanent</li><li>Dependent children, including children coming out of Social Services care or children who have been adopted/fostered. When an applicant applies and the application includes children where there is shared parental responsibility, they will be considered as part of the household if the applicant has the main parental responsibility of the child/children and their address is considered the child’s or children’s main and principal home. This may be demonstrated and will be assessed on factors such as, receipt of benefit, address used to register for doctors, schools, etc. frequency of residence (see Appendix 3).</li><li>Where a person moved in with the applicant at the start of the tenancy and continues to reside with the applicant, it will be reasonable to expect that they should reside with the</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who does not meet the above criteria will not normally be taken into account when considering the accommodation to be offered, with the exception of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Dependent relatives &#8211; where a relative of a tenant has had to join the tenant to receive care and there are no other housing options for the family (examples of housing options in these circumstances include where the relative owns their own property, or occupies a property large enough to accommodate the family). Here, a relative means partners, parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces including step relations and half relations. A need for the care that is provided will need to be</li><li>Carers – in certain circumstances applicants requiring a carer will be registered for an additional bedroom. This could be where the applicant requires personal care both during the day and at night which could only be provided by a live-in carer. It would normally be expected that the person requiring the care be in</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>receipt of Carer’s Allowance and Disability Allowance/Personal Independent Payment (PIP) with the highest care component. The carer must be recognised or employed by or working on behalf of Adult Social Care. It would normally be expected that the carer be a named individual unless care is provided on a rota arrangement made by Adult Social Care or agents on their behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When a member of an applicant’s household is in prison, this person may be included in the household 4 weeks before their confirmed release date from prison as long as they were resident in the household prior to their</li><li>Children who are living with their parents and are studying at university during term times, or serving in the armed forces. In these circumstances their parental home will be considered as their principal</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where an eligible applicant has members of their household who are subject to immigration control or where their terms of entry into the UK prohibit them from a reliance on public funds then they will not be considered to be part of the applicant’s household for the purposes of the Allocations Scheme. However, they will be recognised as living with the applicant as part of their household.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joint Tenancies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joint tenancies will be created in the following circumstances:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Where household members have long term commitments to the home, for example, when adults share accommodation as partners, a joint tenancy should be granted. Applicants will be made aware of this option and will also be made aware of the legal and financial implications and obligations of joint tenancies including the implications for succession rights of partners and children. Where a joint tenancy is refused by the Council the applicant/s must be given reasons why.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the creation of a joint tenancy, both tenants must be present to sign the tenancy agreement. In exceptional circumstances the absent tenant may be able to sign retrospectively; however, the circumstances surrounding the creation of the joint tenancy will need to be assessed to ensure it was valid. This assessment will take in to account historic correspondence from each tenant and the reason why both applicants were not able to attend the sign up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In accordance with s.160ZA (1) (b) Housing Act 1996 as amended, a housing authority shall not grant a joint tenancy to two or more people if one of them is a person from abroad who is ineligible. In these situations a sole tenancy will be granted to the&nbsp; eligible applicant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How we decide the size of property required</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council’s Bedroom Standard is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicant and partner &#8211; 1 bedroom (a single applicant may be offered a self- contained studio flat or a one bedroom property)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Each child or adult requiring a separate bedroom for medical reasons (medical evidence is required) &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>Each adult, or couple, 18 years or over &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>Up to 2 children of either sex under 10 years &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>Up to&nbsp; 2 children&nbsp; of opposite&nbsp; sex over and at&nbsp; least&nbsp; 1 child is over 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; 2 bedrooms</li><li>Up to 2 children of the same sex under 18 years &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>A carer (or group of carers) providing overnight care &#8211; 1 bedroom</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For applicants who are pregnant, the Council will consider their bedroom need including the unborn child, when they reach 30 weeks gestation. For example an applicant (and partner) who is pregnant can be considered for a two-bedroom property but only three months before the expected date of delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Smaller Accommodation than needed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the overall demand on larger sized accommodation, in certain circumstances, applicants may be considered for smaller sized accommodation than that specified under the Council’s bedroom standard as long as this does not result in statutory overcrowding or compromise children of different sex sharing a room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For example, if a household has been awarded with a 4 bedroom need due to a child being over 18 and there is another child of the same sex under 18 in the household, on request, Reading Borough Council will consider allowing them to share to reduce the number of bedrooms that is required, unless this it is not reasonable to do so, for example medical advice, etc.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will only allow a maximum of 2 children per room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accommodation smaller than required will not be considered as standard, it may be considered by the Council where there are particular problems in re-housing a household or upon request.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How we decide the priority of an applicant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each application on the Housing Register will either be placed in a band or will be considered to have No Priority For Housing. This section will detail how Reading Borough Council determines the priority of applicants to the Housing Register and how the band is awarded as a result. Priority is awarded against 2 criteria, as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reasonable Preference</li><li>Additional Preference</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>o Exceptional Strategic Lettings</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bands</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The priority bands are for the purposes of assessing and prioritising the housing needs of households. The bands reflect a scale of need, with the most urgent cases being in Band A and the least urgent cases being awarded No Priority for Housing. All the housing needs of a household within an application will be taken into consideration when determining the priority band, therefore as a household’s circumstances change the priority band may be reassessed. Reading Borough Council awards cumulative priority which means that, if more than one situation applies to a household, they will attract more than one priority banding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The examples outlined within the housing bands do not represent an exhaustive list. Each case will be assessed on its own merits and placed into the priority band accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appendix 1 details the priority bands and circumstances that would attract a level of priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reasonable Preference Categories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Section 166A(3) of The Housing Act 1996 (as inserted by the Localism Act 2011) states that a Local Authority’s Allocations Scheme shall be framed so as to ensure reasonable preference is given to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicants who are homeless within the meaning of Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (including those who are Intentionally Homeless and those not in a priority need)</li><li>Applicants who are owed a duty by any Local Authority under section 190(2)<a href=\"#_bookmark1\"><sup>2</sup></a>, 193(2)<a href=\"#_bookmark2\"><sup>3</sup> </a>or 195(2) of the 1996 Housing Act (or under section 65(2) or 68(2) of the Housing Act 1985) or who are occupying accommodation secured by any housing authority under section 192(3).</li><li>Applicants occupying insanitary or overcrowded housing or otherwise living in unsatisfactory housing conditions. Unsatisfactory housing conditions will be considered where a household lacks kitchen, bathroom, toilet facilities or heating.</li><li>Applicants who need to move on medical or welfare grounds (including grounds related to disability).</li><li>Applicants who need to move to a particular locality in the district of an authority, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or others). This includes applicants to move under the Right to Move Guidance (see appendix 5)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2 Applicants who are threatened with homelessness and in priority need as defined by the Housing Act 1996 Part VII as amended by the Homelessness Act 2002</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 Applicants who are intentionally homeless and are either occupying temporary accommodation for a short period or entitled to advice and assistance as defined by the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who are in priority need and are unintentionally homeless as defined by the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII) as amended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reasonable Preference categories will not be treated in isolation to each other and will be cumulative. Applicants’ housing needs will be assessed taking into account specific housing circumstances, which fall into more than one category as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND A – Emergency need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 5 or more Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND B – Urgent need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 4 Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND C – Intermediate need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 3 Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND D – Identified need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 2 Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND E – Low level need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants with 1 Reasonable Preference category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priority will be awarded for medical and welfare issues assessed. Any priority awarded&nbsp; as a result of this will be taken into account in the context of the overall priority awarded to the application. This may not lead to a cumulative increase in priority if it is below that which the application has already attracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Priority for Housing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who are deemed to be adequately housed or those who have been determined as having No Priority for Housing (see section 18).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Preference</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, section 166A(3) of the 1996 Housing Act (as inserted by the Localism Act 2011) gives housing authorities power to frame their Allocations Scheme to give additional preference to particular descriptions of people who fall within the statutory reasonable preference categories, being those deemed to have an urgent housing need. Assessing the need for additional preference will require evidence from relevant professionals involved, such as Police, Social Care, medical professionals, etc.&nbsp; Applicants who may be given additional priority will include but are not limited to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People at risk of serious violence or threats of serious violence that is likely to be carried out, this includes domestic abuse, racial harassment and hate crimes including Management Transfers (see section 7).</li><li>Witnesses of crime, or victims of crime who would be at risk of intimidation amounting to violence or threats of violence if they remain in their current homes.</li><li>Those who need to move due to an urgent medical reason (see section 8).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Prescribed members of the armed forces as follows:\n<ul><li>former members of the Armed Forces within 5 years of discharge</li><li>serving members of the Armed Forces who need to move because of a serious injury, medical condition or disability sustained as a result of their service</li><li>bereaved spouses and civil partners of members of the Armed Forces leaving Services Family Accommodation following the death of their spouse or partner</li><li>serving or former members of the Reserve Forces who need to move because of serious injury, medical condition or disability sustained as a result of their service</li></ul>\n</li><li>Those who need to move due to an urgent welfare issue</li><li>Those who satisfy the Exceptional Strategic Lettings criteria as set out in section</li><li>and Appendix 1 in order to make best use of housing</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional Preference categories will be assessed and a band will be awarded to reflect the urgency of the housing situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Exceptional Strategic Lettings</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional Preference categories include circumstances where Reading Borough Council needs to best manage the housing stock, known as Exceptional Strategic Lettings. There are some circumstances where Reading Borough Council needs to take steps to manage our stock in the best interests of our current tenants and of those waiting for accommodation. In such circumstances, in order to make best use of the housing stock, the Council will award overriding priority. See Appendix 1 for further information on banding priority and section 27 for further information for tools employed to manage Reading Borough Council’s estates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following situations will attract an increased level of priority (see Appendix 1 for detail):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Succession to a property larger than required and legal action has commenced to recover the property</li><li>Tenants of Reading Borough Council whose homes are being demolished</li><li>Tenants of Reading Borough Council whose properties require major renovation, where a decant to a temporary home while the works are carried out is not a reasonable option</li><li>Tenants of a social housing property living in accommodation larger than they need within Reading Borough Council’s area</li><li>Tenants occupying accommodation with major adaptations that they no longer required or occupying accommodation that is in high demand as assessed by Reading Borough Council</li><li>Any other exceptional circumstances</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Under-occupiers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council will facilitate moves for Reading Borough Council or Registered Provider tenants who are under-occupying their property by at least one bedroom. Tenants that are under-occupiers will be placed in Band B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The size of the alternative accommodation they can be considered for will be that which is appropriate to meet the household’s needs (see section 16).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council operates a Tenant Incentive Scheme, which is subject to change, so applicants will need to confirm any current incentive with their housing officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a dedicated Transfer and Under Occupation Officer who will also offer additional support to anyone who requires support in order to ease their move.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Management Transfers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council may decide that a tenant of Reading Borough Council or a Registered Provider (where the resulting vacancy will be made available to Reading Borough Council) be awarded overriding priority for a move either on a permanent basis, or a temporary basis if the tenant requests this whilst waiting for Reading Borough Council to take possession proceedings against the perpetrators of the anti-social behaviour. This would normally be on an emergency basis, for example, where violence or domestic violence occurs which poses a serious threat to their life or the life of their family or where the risk or likelihood of violence is ongoing and the normal actions of an injunction or other legal action cannot be taken or would be unlikely to afford sufficient protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Management Transfer Panel will consider the following situations for overriding priority (Band A):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tenants of Reading Borough Council or a Registered Provider who are at risk</li><li>Reading Borough Council tenancies where the tenant has left the accommodation leaving other family members in situ</li><li>Potential new tenancy following the death of a tenant in cases where there are no succession rights</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, in exceptional circumstances, the Council may decide to transfer a tenant whose application for a transfer does not attract sufficient priority for a move under the Choice Based Lettings scheme, where his/her behavioural problems, or those of&nbsp; someone within the household, are unavoidably causing severe disruption to neighbours or to the household itself. In such cases the Council retains the right to make a direct allocation (see section 22). This situation could occur where a member of the household has anti-social behaviour issues and, whilst engaging with appropriate services, it is considered that a move would reduce the disruption to neighbours and the household concerned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thorough investigations will be undertaken in respect of all the above situations, including liaison with the Police, Social Services and other agencies to establish the degree and severity of the problem(s) being suffered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approved Management Transfers will be reviewed every 3 months, and approved management transfer applicants will be expected to participate in Homechoice. Management Transfer status will be removed if the circumstances change and an urgent move is no longer required. If the applicant is not bidding, despite suitable properties being available, or has refused offers of suitable accommodation, the refusal sanctions will apply (see section 24.1). The property offered will be suitable for the family size in accordance with bedroom need. The Voids and Lettings Officers will monitor bidding activity and will ensure that bids are made in areas that are safe for the applicant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advice on areas considered safe for the applicant will be given at the time the Management Transfer is accepted. Bids made by applicants to areas where there is deemed to be an on-going risk to the applicant or a household member will not be considered and will be overlooked. This will be confirmed to the applicant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger sized family units can be difficult to secure. This is because of limited social housing resources. It may be necessary to consider a range of options when considering these needs and this may include private rented accommodation under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (see section 26.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overriding priority for an allocation may also be given to a person who has occupied a particular property for a long time and who is not the named tenant, but who has a clear need to remain in the property. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Where the sole tenant has left the property, leaving his or her partner and children in occupation, but the remaining occupier is not a named</li><li>The remaining partner/close family member following the death of a secure tenant even when there is no statutory right to</li><li>Spouses, civil partners or cohabiting couples who would have been able to apply to the courts for an order under Schedule 7 Family Law Act</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the property in question is too big for the remaining occupiers, the Council may offer a secure tenancy of a smaller property that meets the accommodation needs of the remaining occupiers following a successful bid made via Homechoice. This allows the Council to make best use of the housing stock. Any tenancy offered under this section will be an introductory tenancy in the first instance. Examples of factors that the Council will take into account when making its decision may include, but will not be limited to the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The length of time the applicant has shared the former tenant’s home</li><li>The length of time the applicant has been a member of the tenant’s family as defined by Section 113 Housing Act 1985</li><li>The vulnerability and needs of the applicant</li><li>The circumstances in which the tenancy was granted or, as the case requires, the circumstances in which the applicant and his partner became a tenant under the tenancy</li><li>The housing needs and housing resources of the applicant and any relevant child</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The financial resources of the applicant</li><li>The likely effect of any decision by the Council not to exercise its powers on the health, safety, or well-being of the parties and of any relevant child</li><li>The nature of the parties’ relationship</li><li>The length of time during which they cohabited</li><li>Whether there are or have been any children who are children of both parties or for whom both parties have or have had parental responsibility</li><li>The length of time that has elapsed since the parties ceased to live together</li><li>The suitability of the parties as tenants</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant’s request for a Management Transfer is refused, or their status removed, they will be advised of this decision in writing. Applicants have the right to request a review of this decision (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Housing Assessments in Relation to Medical Conditions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have a medical condition that is being worsened by their current housing may complete a medical assessment form, which is also included in the Homechoice Registration Form. Reading Borough Council will consider the medical assessment form to determine if any further priority should be given to their application for housing. All members of the applicant’s household who have submitted medical information will be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Independent Medical Advisor (IMA) and the Voids and Lettings Team&nbsp; consider housing assessments in relation to medical conditions. The IMA is a qualified GP whose services are provided to the Council so that an independent medical assessment can be made on those cases where such an assessment is deemed necessary. If there is no link between the health of the individual and their current housing, the medical assessment form completed by the applicant will not be submitted to the IMA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Voids and Lettings Team will carry out a home visit in some situations in order to clarify the link between an applicant’s health and their home situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IMA and Reading Borough Council will normally assess applicants, and members of the household where applicable, to ascertain composite need on the basis of the information supplied by the applicant/tenant. In certain circumstances, a member of the Voids and Lettings Team, or the IMA, will contact the GP or other medical professional involved for further advice or to require a visit be made to confirm/clarify information provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be allocated a medical priority the applicant’s illness/disability must be linked to their housing circumstances. For example, difficulty accessing parts of their accommodation because it has not been adapted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In cases where the accommodation occupied has a very severe or life threatening impact on an applicant’s medical condition, a Band A priority will be awarded. In other circumstances, priority will be awarded on a scale to Band E (which would reflect a minimal but recognised impact on an applicant’s health). Where it is assessed that the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>housing situation is not detrimental to the applicant’s medical condition no banding based on medical circumstances will be awarded. An elevation in an applicant’s overall band may not always occur, for example if the band awarded for medical reasons is lower than the applicant’s band prior to the assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain Reading Borough Council and Registered Provider properties have been specially designed or adapted for use by applicants with a disability. In allocating to these properties, priority is given to those who require those adaptations. We will seek advice from an Occupational Therapist on the suitability of any accommodation required for those with a disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On occasions, the IMA will make recommendations regarding the type of property that will be suitable to meet the needs of certain applicants. This information will be provided to the applicant and if a bid is received for unsuitable accommodation based on the recommendations, the Voids and Lettings Team may disregard the bid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IMA or the Voids and Lettings Team may recommend that an application is reassessed. This may be because improvements may have been carried out to the current accommodation e.g. adaptations that should alleviate the medical need or if an applicant’s medical condition deteriorates and they provide further medical evidence. Applicants can request their medical assessment to be reassessed and this may be completed by another medical partner or by the Voids and Lettings Team. However there must be a clear change in the circumstances for an assessment to be reassessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Disabled Applicants – Aids and Adaptations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant with limited mobility wants to remain in their home and it is suitable for adaptations, they can apply to the Renovations Team for a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) to adapt their current home. Decisions regarding DFGs are made by the DFG Panel following the process documented in Housing Adaptations Policy (February 2011), which is available at: <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/residents/housing/grants/disabled-facilities-grants\">www.reading.gov.uk/residents/housing/grants/disabled-facilities-grants</a> It will be necessary to have an Occupational Therapist’s assessment to help the applicant/tenant through this process. It should be noted that, where it is possible to move an applicant to a suitable alternative property, agreement may not be given for adaptations to their existing home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Social/Welfare Scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The social/welfare scheme is designed to assess those situations where an applicant’s accommodation is detrimental to their needs because of social and welfare reasons. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A vulnerable applicant is being exploited within their accommodation, putting them at risk</li><li>An applicant needs to move on from Supported Accommodation into independent accommodation</li><li>An applicant may be capable of, and best suited to, independent living provided that the necessary support mechanisms are in place. Welfare priority will be awarded in order to avoid a residential placement having to be made</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An applicant is in hospital with a discharge date but cannot return to their original accommodation because it is unsuitable</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not an exhaustive list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases are assessed by the Voids and Lettings Team and will be based on evidence received from other professionals in support of the application. The award of priority can range from Band A, where there are exceptional social/welfare issues, to Band D. See Appendix 1 for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Priority for Housing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who do not meet the criteria set out in section 17 with regard to reasonable or additional preference will be considered to have No Priority for Housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be situations where an applicant will have No Priority for Housing even though their application might otherwise attract reasonable and/or additional preference (see section 17). The following is a list of such applicants:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Owner-occupiers, whether the property that they own is in the UK or abroad, unless one of the following apply:</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The applicant, or a member of their household, requires adaptations that are not possible in their owned accommodation; or</li><li>The applicant and partner are over the age of 60 and there is a need for Sheltered accommodation that they are unable to secure by purchasing a property of this type; or</li><li>The property owned by the applicant is in negative equity and their property is unaffordable for</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Each case will be considered individually. The personal circumstances of each application will be taken into consideration and an assessment will be made regarding their financial ability to secure their own accommodation, including private rented accommodation. If accommodation is awarded to the applicant via Homechoice, Reading Borough Council will expect their owned property to be sold within 1 year of the allocation and evidence of this will be required.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicants who have financial resources available to meet their housing costs (section 166A(5) of the 1996 Housing Act) for example: assets, savings or a level of disposable income that could be reasonably applied to securing alternative accommodation in either the owner-occupied/low cost home ownership or private rented sector. Each case will be considered individually, taking into account all relevant financial and personal circumstances of both the applicant and of the housing</li><li>Applicants who have deliberately worsened their living conditions in an attempt to increase their opportunities for re-housing. For example, where an applicant occupies a property, which is suitable for their needs, and relinquishes it for less</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>suitable housing. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band and this could be for a period of up to 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicants who have had a change of circumstance and have not informed the Council. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band until a new Homechoice Registration Form has been received at which point, following the assessment, priority will be awarded to reflect the new situation. It is the applicant’s responsibility to notify the Voids and Lettings Team of any change in circumstances as soon as</li><li>Applicants who are subject to possession proceedings by either the Council or a Registered Provider, due to breach of tenancy or licence which includes rent arrears and anti-social behaviour (section 166A(5) of the 1996 Housing Act).</li><li>Applicants who are applying to buy their Council property or being considered for other housing options such as Shared Ownership/Homebuy. Such applicants may not be considered for an allocation of accommodation. However, each case will be considered individually, taking account of all relevant circumstances</li><li>Council or Registered Provider tenants where the property and/or garden of their existing home is not in a tenantable condition. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band until the condition of either the property or the garden has improved (depending on the circumstances of each case).</li><li>Council tenants who have made unauthorised alterations to their property and have either not carried out remedial works or have not paid necessary recharge amounts.</li><li>Applicants who have a current or a proven history of rents arrears and/or anti- social behaviour. In such cases the Council may stipulate certain conditions, which must be met. This could be making agreements to clear rent arrears, or adhering to a Behaviour Agreement. Any debt must be legally recoverable for this to</li><li>Applicants who are found to be intentionally homeless within the homelessness legislation. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 12</li><li>Applicants who have refused a direct offer of accommodation will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 12</li><li>Homeless households who have refused a final offer of accommodation will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 12</li><li>Applicants who have received major adaptations to their home via the Disabled Facilities Grant will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 5 years. If during this time the property becomes unsuitable for the applicant due to medical need this will be assessed on a case by case</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Any successful bid(s) made by an applicant in one of the above groups may be disregarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above groups may however be given priority for re-housing in exceptional circumstances such as serious medical or welfare needs. Each case will be decided on&nbsp; its merits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key Workers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council’s Planning Framework outlines that most affordable housing within the Borough will be socially rented. Of which, a proportion of this accommodation will be exclusively advertised for Key Workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Key Worker definition will vary depending on the grant allocated to Registered Providers for developing the scheme. The Council also has its local definition of a Key Worker, defined as someone who:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lives or works in Reading and</li><li>Is employed by the public sector (Reading Borough Council, Royal Berkshire and Battle Hospital NHS Trust, Royal Berkshire Ambulance NHS Trust, Reading Primary Care Trust, Thames Valley Police, Royal Berkshire Fire &amp; Rescue Service, Reading Buses) and</li><li>Is delivering an essential public service</li><li>Is in a post where there are serious recruitment and retention problems</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In Reading this includes (but is not limited to) nurses and other NHS staff, teachers in schools, further education and Sixth Form colleges, Police Officers and some civilian staff, Social Care workers (which can include Housing Officers), Occupational Therapists, Planners, Fire-fighters, Bus Drivers and ancillary staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key Worker opportunities are advertised via Reading’s Homechoice however they may also be able to register with the Zone Agent which in Reading is the Catalyst Housing Group and who can be contacted on 0845 6017729.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tied Accommodation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to meet the Council’s commitment to making offers of accommodation to those with the greatest need and maximising the resources available, those applicants who live in tied accommodation, including those occupying service accommodation, will not have an automatic right to be offered accommodation, but will be able to register on the Housing Register. They will be assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the applicant loses their right to occupy their accommodation, then they will be treated in the same way as anyone else losing their home under the provisions of the Homelessness legislation (Part VII Housing Act 1996, as amended). With the exception of those occupying Armed Forces tied accommodation (see section 17).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocations Plan and Social Care Groups</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quota Queues</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social Care Groups</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year Reading Borough Council will review the needs of those housed. This will inform quotas for different social care groups, meaning that individuals within these groups may be given additional priority. The number of individual quotas for each queue will be calculated on an annual basis. The awarding of this priority will be considered in consultation with social care groups or agencies. From time to time, it may also be necessary to restrict adverts to specific groups. This could be in circumstances where a specific group of applicants are experiencing acute housing difficulties or where there is a need to intervene to enable community cohesion in neighbourhoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The different community and quota queue groups are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Young people leaving</li><li>Young Persons. This may include teenage parents and 16/17 year olds. The Young Persons Housing Panel will determine which individuals are included in the</li><li>Single Homeless People. This may include rough sleepers where there are no specific support needs, and people moving on from the Homelessness Pathway. The Move On Options Panel determines which individuals are included in the quota.</li><li>People with Adult Social Care needs who need to leave supported accommodation to live more independently. This will include those accessing Mental Health Services, Learning and Physical Disabilities Services. The Adult Social Care/Housing Panel determines which individuals are included in the</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Right to Move Quota Queue</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year Reading Borough Council will review the needs of those social housing tenants who live outside of the borough and need to move to Reading to be nearer to work or to take up an offer of work. (see appendix 5). 1% of lettings will be offered to this group per year and the Council will manage this quota by restricting adverts to this group. An annual analysis will take place to determine the proportion of property sizes required to meet the needs of this group</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further quota queue groups may be identified based on housing need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In each case supporting information will be provided to the Voids and Lettings Team to enable assessment of a social care or quota queue case. This information will be provided by a supporting agency such as Adult Social Care, Children’s Services or a commissioned service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant’s band is elevated for the purpose of a quota queue, the housing situation will be reviewed every 3 months and any change of circumstances will be considered, which may result in the priority being removed. Applicants will be able to refuse 2 reasonable offers of accommodation (see section 24) and following this a direct offer will be made (see section 22)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though quota queues are in place, larger sized family units can be difficult to secure. This is because of limited social housing resources. It may be necessary to consider a range of options when considering these needs and this may include private rented accommodation under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (see section 26.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fostering and Adoption</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Children’s Social Care have a duty under section 22 of the Children Act 1989 to ensure sufficient accommodation to meet the needs of Looked After Children, as defined in that Act, in their area. Housing Needs will work together with Children’s Social Care to best meet the needs of prospective and approved foster carers and adopters. The Council will consider the circumstances of each individual to determine whether a move to alternative accommodation is required to facilitate adoption or fostering of a child to whom the Local Authority has a responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priority will be determined under welfare reasonable preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct Offers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A direct offer of accommodation is made when the Council selects a person for a vacant property rather than an applicant participating in Homechoice at Reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain circumstances Reading Borough Council may make direct offers to applicants. Examples of this are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People requiring accommodation on hospital discharge when they have no alternative housing to move to and the discharge is likely to be</li><li>Applicants that have been accepted for a Management Transfer who are not participating in the scheme despite suitable social housing vacancies arising or who have refused 2 reasonable offers of accommodation (see section 24). Homelessness applicants already placed in temporary accommodation by Reading Borough Council in a property that would otherwise be general needs permanent accommodation (permanent accommodation used as temporary accommodation) where this property is considered suitable as permanent accommodation it can be offered as</li><li>Homeless applicants who are not participating in Homechoice at Reading (see section 23).</li><li>Applicants where the Management Transfer Panel have agreed that they should remain in the property in circumstances where the tenant is no longer residing there. These cases will be assessed to show there is a clear need for the family to remain, if they have resided there for a significant period as their only and principal home, and if the property is suitable for their</li><li>Successful completion of a FIT (see section 1).</li><li>Reading Borough Council tenants whose behaviour is causing severe disruption to neighbours or to the household itself (see section 7).</li><li>Applicants considered as part of a quota queue who are not participating in Homechoice at Reading despite suitable social housing vacancies arising, or who have refused 2 offers of suitable accommodation (see section 24).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Decant and Regeneration schemes where the applicants are subject to notice under section 10 of the 1985 Housing Act and has been given the opportunity to participate within Homechoice but have failed to do so</li><li>Any other exceptional or mitigating</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council also reserves the right to make direct offers of accommodation outside the Choice Based Lettings scheme in certain circumstances. Examples include (but are not be limited to) those situations where the Council believes it is necessary to intervene on an estate to promote sustainability of an area or promote community cohesion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally only one direct offer will be made before sanctions will apply (see section 24).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homelessness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants owed the main homelessness duty by Reading Borough Council will be expected to actively participate with Homechoice at Reading. Assistance will be given to vulnerable households to help them to bid for accommodation. The Council will distinguish between those applicants who are participating in Homechoice at Reading and those who are not, and different sanctions will apply to both groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Those participating in the scheme</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants owed the main homelessness duty and who successfully bid for accommodation via Homechoice at Reading will only have the opportunity to refuse 1 reasonable offer of suitable accommodation, without incurring a penalty. If a homeless applicant refuses a second reasonable offer of suitable accommodation then the main homelessness duty will come to an end and no further offer of accommodation will be made to the applicant. The second offer will be considered to be the Final Offer under Part VII of 1996 Housing Act as amended. If at this time the applicant is in temporary accommodation they will be given a Notice to Quit, as the first stage towards gaining possession of the temporary accommodation. The applicant will then be considered to have No Priority for Housing for a period of 1 year (see section 18).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bids from homeless households will be reviewed every 4 weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Those not participating in the scheme</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>If homeless applicants choose not to participate in Homechoice by not making bids on accommodation which has been advertised and which is suitable for them, for example flats and maisonettes, or properties in particular areas, they will be made a direct offer (see section 22).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within 6 months of the homeless duty being accepted, if there have been suitable properties advertised and no bids have been placed the applicants will be made a direct offer. The offer will be made no sooner than 6 months after the homeless duty has been accepted, and as soon as a suitable property can be identified. If a direct offer is made, this will be considered to be a Final Offer under Part VII of 1996 Housing Act as amended. If the applicant accepts the direct offer the main homelessness duty will end. If the applicant refuses the direct offer the main homelessness duty will end and no further offers of accommodation will be made. If the applicant at this time is in temporary accommodation they will be given a Notice to Quit, as the first stage towards  gaining  possession  of  the  temporary  accommodation.       The applicant will then be considered to have No Priority for Housing for a period of 1 year (see section 18). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3> <strong>Right to Request a Review</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All applicants who are owed the main homelessness duty by Reading Borough Council will have a right to request a review of decisions regarding:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>suitability of the accommodation</li><li>the ending of their homelessness duty</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The request must be made in writing to the Voids and Lettings Team Leader within 21 days of the original decision (see section 24.3)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the applicant has chosen to move into the property offered and requests a review of the suitability of that accommodation, and the original decision is upheld, then they will be required to remain in the property as it will be deemed to be suitable. No further offers of accommodation will be made and the main homelessness duty will end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the original decision is not upheld, the property will be deemed not to be suitable and the applicant will be able to express an interest in other properties as soon as it is possible. In the meantime they will be expected to remain in the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refusals and Sanctions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In circumstances where an applicant refuses a suitable offer of accommodation Reading Borough Council will impose sanctions. This is to ensure that any delay does not have an adverse impact on others with a housing need that may want the same accommodation and to prevent property void time increasing (the time it takes to re-let properties).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refusal of suitable accommodation will be considered as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Failure to attend a viewing which if you had attended would have led to an offer of accommodation – unless good reasons are stated</li><li>Failure to complete a Registered Provider application form which, on completion, would have led to an offer of accommodation</li><li>Attending a viewing and then refusing the property without good reason</li><li>For certain groups e.g. homeless households, Management Transfers and quota queues, failure to participate in Homechoice at Reading, includes not bidding on properties that are advertised and that are suitable, or only placing bids on certain types of properties or certain</li><li>Refusal of a property offered as a direct</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sanctions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have refused 3 suitable properties within a 6 month period will be removed from the Housing Register and cannot reapply for a period of 1 year from the date of the last refusal (see section 24).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where an applicant has been removed from the Housing Register and the applicant wishes to re-apply after the sanction period a new Homechoice Registration Form will be required to allow a new assessment of circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain groups may be limited to fewer refusals, for example, homeless households, Management Transfer, quota queues. For these groups the Council will consider placing them in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 1 year (see section 18).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where an applicant has received a direct offer (see section 22) and subsequently refuses this, Reading Borough Council reserves the right to remove an applicant’s priority. When assessing the reasons for refusal, Reading Borough Council will have regard to the applicant’s circumstances and the reasons why the direct offer was made. Each case will be considered on its merits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Procedure for refusal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant refuses accommodation, including a direct offer of accommodation, officers will look at all the circumstances of the case to decide:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Whether the offer is suitable and reasonable, and</li><li>Whether the reasons given for refusal are reasonable</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will be contacted to arrange a viewing for a convenient time. If a viewing is arranged, but subsequently the applicant decides not to view the property, they must notify the Voids and Lettings Team within 24 hours of the viewing being arranged. The Voids and Lettings Team will discuss the reasons for not attending the viewing and will consider if this is a reasonable refusal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who wish to refuse a property following a viewing must notify the Voids and Lettings Team within 24 hours. This is normally done by completing a Refusal form giving comprehensive reasons for their refusal. Where requested, the officer carrying out the accompanied viewing of the property will assist applicants to complete the form. This form must be returned to the Voids and Lettings Team within 24 hours of viewing the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council will notify the applicant in writing if their reason for refusing the property if considered a reasonable refusal or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Request for reviews</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants registering for social housing in the Borough will be provided with written decisions regarding their housing application along with details of the process to request a review of that decision. In the following circumstances applicants have the right to request a review:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The decision not to place an applicant on the Housing Register due to their eligibility</li><li>The decision not to place an applicant on the Housing Register due to the qualification criteria</li><li> Any decision about the facts of the applicant’s case which is likely to be, or has been taken into account, in considering whether to allocate housing accommodation</li><li>The removal of an application from the Housing Register</li><li>The suitability of a property which has been offered </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In circumstances where an applicant wishes to request a review of a decision, then such a request should be made in writing and addressed to the Council’s Voids and Lettings Team Leader. It should set out the reasons for requesting a review and should be made within 21 days of being notified of the decision in question. A senior officer, not involved in the original decision, will complete an investigation. The applicant will be notified of the decision of the review within eight weeks of the date from when they requested a review. If a longer period is needed, the applicant will be consulted about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants may be able to challenge some review decisions by way of judicial review via the County Courts. The Authority will recommend that the applicant seeks legal advice before taking these steps, or advice from the voluntary sector, such as the Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessibility and Supporting Vulnerable Customers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will receive support and assistance where necessary. Reading Borough Council will continue to work with statutory and voluntary organisations and to meet regularly to support vulnerable groups to access our service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All documents will be available upon request in a number of different languages and formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council will allow sufficient and support time for people with disabilities to engage in the Allocations process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Options including out of area</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reciprocal Arrangements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the Authority will only consider applicants that fall within the Allocations Scheme, although there will be times when Reading Borough Council will agree to assist another local authority or a Registered Provider on a reciprocal basis. This would normally be in an emergency situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All reciprocal arrangements are discretionary and the Council reserves the right to decline a request for a reciprocal transfer. All requests will be agreed in conjunction with the Assistant Housing Needs Manager and priority for a move will be in line with the Allocations Scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some circumstances, the Council may agree to accept two smaller units of accommodation in exchange for a larger property of the same number of bedrooms. The reciprocal authority or Registered Provider will be required to provide written</p>\n\n\n\n<p>commitment to the terms of the reciprocal arrangement. We will treat any agreed reciprocal applicant in line with our management transfer applicants (see section 17.7).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When agreeing any reciprocal transfer the Council would expect a replacement transfer within 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Applications to Move Out of Reading</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will need to apply directly to the Local Authority that they wish to move to so that they can register to go on to their Housing Register. Any such application will be subject to the policies and procedures of that receiving Local Authority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rent Guarantee Scheme (RGS)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council promotes the RGS as an option for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness who are considered to have a vulnerability to allow them to access privately rented accommodation. Landlords joining the scheme offer good quality rented properties and let them through the RGS. Each property is checked prior to letting and vulnerable households are supported to enable them to sustain their accommodation. The RGS works by guaranteeing a deposit to the landlord and the tenant then contributes towards the deposit by making regular payments to Reading Borough Council over a period of up to three years. We will ensure that once saved the deposit will be protected for the tenants future use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On occasions, severely overcrowded secure tenants may consider the RGS as an option to alleviate their housing difficulties. This aspect of the Allocations Scheme will only be aimed at severely overcrowded households requiring 4+ bedrooms and will only be offered if it is deemed affordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mutual Exchanges</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Council or Registered Provider tenants can swap their homes providing their landlord has given permission.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Eligibility &#8211; the scheme is open to all secure Council tenants and Registered Provider tenants subject to the agreement of their</li><li>Applications &#8211; when two eligible tenants agree to exchange properties, they are each required to submit an application form to the Council’s Tenant Services. If one of the parties is a tenant from another landlord, then each will be required to submit an application to the other landlord. The housing officer will make a home visit and a decision will be communicated in writing to each party. Applications can be refused on one or more of the grounds set down in Schedule 3 to the Housing Act 1985 and schedule 14 to the Localism Act</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where applicants are exchanging with a Registered Provider landlord they are advised to make enquiries regarding the level of security of tenure (type of tenancy agreement) and the type of rent to be paid with the exchanging landlord.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Homeswapper website at <a href=\"http://www.homeswapper.co.uk/\">www.homeswapper.co.uk</a> holds a register of tenants looking to exchange their properties and an application to join the Housing Register will result in a free registration to Homeswapper if this is requested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent must be paid up to date before an exchange can take place unless:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>there is a Housing benefit claim being processed that will clear the arrears or</li><li>one or both of the tenants have been approved for a Management Transfer</li><li>there is an agreement in place to pay off the outstanding arrears</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If one of the tenants has breached the terms of his or her tenancy agreement, consent to the exchange may be given subject to a condition requiring the tenant to remedy the breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exchanges take place on the basis that they are not a liability to the Council.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Assisted Purchase of Properties</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various schemes, supported by the government, to assist households wishing to become home-owners. Examples of these include shared ownership, Help to Buy,&nbsp; New Buy schemes and Right to Buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These schemes change to reflect the prevailing climate and therefore details of current schemes available should be obtained from the Voids and Lettings Team on 0118 937 2172 or you may find details online. At time of print (September 2014) Radian Group is the Zone Agent in Berkshire for Help to Buy, <a href=\"http://www.helptobouysouth.co.uk/\">www.helptobouysouth.co.uk</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estate management</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sensitive Allocations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This element of the Council’s scheme addresses the imbalance between the demand for and supply of one-bedroom units for non-elderly households.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council recognises that incompatibility may arise when mixing different age groups and it is accepted that a degree of sensitivity will be required when making such allocations to blocks designated for applicants over 50 years old. The housing officer&nbsp; will always consult with tenants in assessing the suitability of the applicant for age designated properties if they are below the set age requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not apply to Sheltered Housing schemes which will continue to be allocated to elderly applicants only.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Low Demand Properties</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of a strategy to keep the level of empty properties in the Council’s stock as low as possible and to minimise the time it takes to re-let a property that becomes empty (the ‘turnaround’ time), the Council must address the issue of ‘lower demand’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>properties. Low Demand properties are those that are difficult to let. In Reading the properties that have a lower demand generally fall into the following broad categories:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sheltered Accommodation (above ground floor or self-contained studio flat)</li><li>Age Designated 50+</li><li>Maisonettes and flats over shops</li><li>Properties in less ‘popular’ areas (or even specific roads)</li><li>Flats generally, but particularly high-rise</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where properties are deemed to be low demand, from time to time, initiatives may be put in place to increase the popularity of these properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Local Lettings Policies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Local Lettings policies have been developed to contribute towards community cohesion and sustainability within neighbourhoods. Local Lettings policies are usually implemented where there have been housing management issues, such as anti-social behaviour. The objective of Local Lettings policies is to enable the development of balanced and sustainable communities. Local Lettings policies will be developed in consultation with current tenants unless there are mitigating circumstances that require an urgent response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People applying for housing on estates where Local Lettings policies are in place may be subject to the terms of the specific policy, for example the undertaking of Police checks. The policies are reviewed annually with applicants/tenants and in partnership with the Police and local Councillors to ensure they are still relevant and necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Decants and Regeneration Scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to facilitate major repairs programmes or to accommodate tenants whose properties become uninhabitable (due to such incidents as a fire or flood) the Council operates a Decant policy. Whilst these major repair works are being carried out the Council has an obligation to re-house (temporarily) those tenants who are affected. In exceptional circumstances, a tenant who has a high priority for a transfer will be moved into permanent alternative accommodation in order to avoid two moves in a short space of time or where the regeneration scheme will not provide the size of accommodation required. Where a transfer applicant’s home is within a regeneration scheme and the applicant has been given the opportunity to participate within the scheme and has failed to do so, the authority will make a direct offer of accommodation (see section 22) See also the Decant factsheet for more information <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/residents%E2%80%8C/housing/CouncilTenants/publications-advice-and-factsheets/factsheets-publications/\">www.reading.gov.uk/residents</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/residents%E2%80%8C/housing/CouncilTenants/publications-advice-and-factsheets/factsheets-publications/\">/housing/CouncilTenants/publications-advice-and-factsheets/factsheets-publications/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Succession</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Succession is when a surviving family member of a deceased tenant has the right under the Housing Act to take over the tenancy agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Section 86A Housing Act 1985 sets out those persons qualified to succeed the tenant as including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A tenant’s spouse, civil partner, common law spouse or common law civil partner</li><li>Another close family member of the tenant as prescribed by the local authority who has been residing with the tenant throughout the period of twelve months prior to the death of the</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council has prescribed the following who can claim to be a close family member of the tenant as including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Parent</li><li>Grandparent</li><li>Grandchild</li><li>Child</li><li>Brother</li><li>Sister</li><li>Uncle</li><li>Aunt</li><li>Nephew</li><li>Niece</li><li>(including relationships by marriage, civil partnership, step relationships and other children regardless of the marital status of the tenant)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where there is no right to a statutory succession the Council, in acting as a good landlord, may exercise its discretion to offer a new tenancy in certain circumstances (see section 17.7).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Assignment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An assignment occurs when a Council tenancy is passed from one person to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secure tenancies cannot be assigned except in the following circumstances as set out The Housing Act 1985 Section 91 (as amended):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An assignment by way of exchange. There are certain grounds on which the Council can refuse a Mutual Exchange. These are set out in schedule 3 to Housing Act 1985 (as amended)</li><li>An assignment in pursuance of a court order including:</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Section 23A or 24 Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 – property adjustment orders in connection with matrimonial</li><li>Section 17(1) Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 – property adjustment orders after overseas divorce</li><li>Para 1 of Sch 1 Children’s Act 1989 – orders for financial relief against parents</li><li>Part 2 of Sch 5 or para 9(2) to (3) Sch 7 Civil Partnership Act 2004 – property adjustment orders in connection with civil partnership proceedings or after overseas dissolution of a civil partnership</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the court makes an order, the Council can tell the court why it does not want the tenancy to be assigned to the applicant.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An assignment to a person who would be qualified to succeed if the tenant died immediately before the</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The assignee may only include the following people on their application:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cohabiting partner</li><li>Dependent children normally resident with the main applicant</li><li>Adult relatives reasonably expected to reside with the main applicant, who moved into the property at the same times as the assignee and who live in the property as their only or principal</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering normal residence or whether it is reasonable to expect to reside the Council will have regard to Appendix 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>APPENDIX 1: Banding Scheme</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<strong>Band A</strong>\n<em>Emergency need to move</em>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Band B</strong>\n<em>Urgent need to move</em>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Band C</strong>\n<em>Intermediate need to move</em>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Band D</strong>\n<em>Identified need to move</em>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Band E</strong>\n<em>Low Level need to move</em>\n</td><td>\n<strong>No Priority for Housing</strong>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<strong>Reasonable Preference</strong>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\nApplicants with 5 Reasonable Preference Categories*\n</td><td>\nApplicants with 4 Reasonable Preference\nCategories*\n</td><td>\nApplicants with 3 Reasonable Preference\nCategories*\n</td><td>\nApplicants with 2 Reasonable Preference\nCategories*\n</td><td>\nApplicants with 1 Reasonable Preference\nCategory*\n</td><td>\nDo not meet any of the criteria for Reasonable\nPreference\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<em>* With the exception of medical or welfare priority</em>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<strong>Additional Preference</strong>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\nVery severe/life threatening need to move on medical or\nwelfare grounds\n</td><td>\nSevere need to move on medical or welfare grounds\n</td><td>\nModerate need to move on medical or welfare grounds\n</td><td>\nMild need to move on medical or welfare grounds\n</td><td>\nMinor need to move on medical or welfare grounds\n</td><td>\nNo need to move on medical or welfare grounds\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<strong>Management Transfer</strong>\n<strong>– </strong>those who have been accepted as being at risk in their accommodation and accepted as a Management Transfer\n&nbsp;\n<strong>Supported by a signed approved Management Transfer Application from the panel</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Hospital Discharge</strong>\n<strong>– </strong>Where a move is urgently required because the client is bed blocking and it is not possible for them to return to their previous accommodation as it is unsuitable on medical grounds.\n&nbsp;\n<strong>Evidence will be required from the hospital and Community Care</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Support – </strong>Where a move is required to be\ncloser to a relative to give or receive support that is substantial and ongoing and where the carer is unable to travel across Reading\n&nbsp;\n<strong>Evidence will be required in relation to welfare benefits paid to confirm the need</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Sheltered Accommodation – </strong>Where an actual need has been identified for sheltered accommodation as opposed to a desire\n&nbsp;\n<strong>Evidence of medical, social/welfare identified at sheltered home visit</strong>\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\n</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>\n&nbsp;\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\n</td><td>\n<strong>for the carer to support the individual.

Local housing authorities (housing authorities) are required to have regard to it in exercising their functions under Part 6 of the 1996 Act</li><li> It is in addition to the Guidance for Local Housing Authorities in England on the Allocation of Accommodation issued in June 2012 (‘the 2012 guidance’). </li><li> References to sections in this guidance are references to sections in the 1996 Act. </li><li> Housing authorities are encouraged to review their existing allocation policies and revise them, where appropriate, in the light of this guidance as soon as possible</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Purpose of the guidance</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The Government is committed to increasing mobility for social tenants to enable tenants to meet their aspirations, and to support them into work. We want to ensure that tenants are not prevented from taking up an employment opportunity because they cannot find a suitable place to live, recognising that long term unemployment is damaging for individuals and communities. That is why in the Autumn Statement 2013 we set out our intention to introduce a light to Move for social tenants who need to move to take up a job or live closer to employment or training</li><li> We’ve already taken some important steps in the right direction. <em>HomeSwap </em>Direct is helping social tenants search for a new home across the country. Through the Localism Act, we have given local authorities the freedom to make better use of the social housing stock by taking transferring tenants who are not in housing need out of the allocation legislation, allowing authorities to develop appropriate policies for transferring tenants, without the risk of challenge from those in greater need on the waiting list</li><li> The Government has also taken decisive steps to increase the supply of affordable housing. The current Affordable Homes Programme is on track to deliver 170,000 homes between 2011 and 2015 with £19.5 billion of public and private investment. A further £38 billion of public and private investment will help deliver another 275,000 new affordable homes between 2015 and 2020. </li><li> To give effect to the Right to Move we have introduced regulations to prevent local authorities applying a local connection test that could disadvantage tenants who need to move across local authority boundaries for work related reasons. This guidance is intended to assist local authorities to implement these regulations.</li><li> The Government has made clear that we expect social homes to go to people who genuinely need and deserve them. That is why the Localism Act has maintained the protection provided by the statutory reasonable preference criteria which ensure that priority for social housing continues to be given to those in the greatest housing need. </li><li> Another important aim of this guidance, therefore, is to assist local authorities to apply the allocation legislation to ensure that tenants who need to move within or across local authority boundaries are given appropriate priority under local authorities’ allocation schemes.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Qualification</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Section 160ZA(7) provides that local authorities may decide who does or does not qualify for an allocation of social housing, subject to any regulations made under subsection 8 which provides that the Secretary of State may prescribe that certain classes of persons are or are not qualifying persons, or that certain criteria cannot be taken into account in deciding who qualifies.</li><li> Subject to parliamentary scrutiny, the Allocation of Housing (Qualification Criteria for Right to Move) (England) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/967) (‘the qualification regulations 2015’) will come into force on 20 April. These provide that local authorities must not disqualify certain persons on the grounds that they do not have a local connection with the authority’s district. Specifically, a local connection may not be applied to existing social tenants seeking to transfer from another local authority district in England who: <ul><li> have reasonable preference under s.166(3)(e) because of a need to move to the local authority’s district to avoid hardship, and</li><li>need to move because the tenant works in the district, or</li><li>need to move to take up an offer of work </li></ul></li><li> This will ensure that existing tenants who are seeking to move between local authority areas in England in order to be closer to their work, or to take up an offer of work (hereafter referred to together as ‘work related reasons’), will not be disadvantaged.</li><li> We have made a similar provision for certain members of the Armed Forces community, by regulating to prevent local authorities from applying a local connection requirement to disqualify them1, in order to give effect to the Government’s commitment that those who serve in the Armed Forces are not disadvantaged in their access to social housing by the need to move from base to base. Aside from members of the Armed Forces and transferring   tenants who will benefit from the Right to Move, the Government has made clear that we expect local authorities to ensure that only long standing local residents, or those with a well established local association should qualify for social housing, and has issued statutory guidance to ensure that local authorities apply a residency test to social housing of at least two years. </li><li></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>1 The Allocation of Housing (Qualification Criteria for Armed Forces) (England) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1869)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 Providing Social Housing for Local People: Statutory guidance on social housing allocations for local authorities in England.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Local connection</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local connection is defined by s.199. A person has a local connection because of normal residence (current or previous) of their own choice, employment, family associations, or special</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Need to move</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The qualification regulations 2015 apply to transferring tenants who have reasonable preference under s.166A(3)(e), that is to say the local authority is satisfied that they need to move to a particular locality in the district of the housing authority, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or others).</li><li> The local authority must ensure, therefore, not simply that the tenant needs to movefor work, but that, if they were unable to do so, it would cause them hardship.</li><li> Local authorities must be satisfied that the tenant needs, rather than wishes, to move for work related reasons. In the Secretary of State’s view the factors that local authorities should take into account in determining whether a tenant needs to move to be closer to work or to take up a job offer include: <ul><li> the distance and/or time taken to travel between work and home</li><li>the availability and affordability of transport, taking into account level of earnings</li><li>the nature of the work and whether similar opportunities are available closer to home</li><li>other personal factors, such as medical conditions and child care, which would be affected if the tenant could not move</li><li>the length of the work contract</li><li>whether failure to move would result in the loss of an opportunity to improve their employment circumstances or prospects, for example, by taking up a better job, a promotion, or an apprenticeship </li></ul></li><li> This is not an exhaustive list and local authorities may wish to consider providing for other appropriate factors to take into account in the light of local circumstances. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Work</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The qualification regulations 2015 only apply if work is not short-term or marginal in nature, nor ancillary to work in another district. Voluntary work is also excluded.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Short-term</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In determining whether work is short-term, the Secretary of State considers that the following are relevant considerations:</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>whether work is regular or intermittent</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely to be particularly relevant in the case of the self-employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>the period of employment and whether or not work was intended to be short- term or long-term at the outset</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Secretary of State’s view a contract of employment that was intended to last for less than 12 months could be considered to be short-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Marginal</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The following considerations would be relevant in determining whether work is marginal:</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>the number of hours worked</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Secretary of State’s view employment of less than 16 hours a week could be considered to be marginal in nature. This is the threshold below which a person may be able to claim Income Support and the threshold for a single person’s entitlement to Working Tax Credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>the level of earnings</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities should take into account all the relevant factors when reaching a decision. The fact that a tenant only works 15 hours a week, for example, may not be determinative if they are able to demonstrate that the work is regular and the remuneration is</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ancillary</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Work must not be ancillary to work in another local authority’s district. This means that, if the person works occasionally in the local authority’s district, even if the pattern of work is regular, but their main place of work is in a different local authority’s district, the work is excluded from the ambit of these regulations.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A further relevant consideration would be whether the tenant is expected eventually to return to work in the original local authority district. If a local authority has reason to believe this is the case, they should seek verification from the tenant’s</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A person who seeks to move into a local authority to be closer to work in a neighbouring authority – for example, where the transport links are better in the first local authority’s area – is also excluded from these regulations. However, there is nothing to prevent local authorities looking sympathetically</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>on tenants seeking to move into their authority’s district for this reason, if they choose to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Voluntary work</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The regulations exclude voluntary work. Voluntary work means work where no payment is received or the only payment is in respect of any expenses reasonably</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apprenticeship</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The term ‘work’ includes an apprenticeship. This is because an apprenticeship normally takes place under an apprenticeship agreement which is an employment contract (specifically a contract of service).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Genuine intention to take up an offer of work</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Where the tenant has been offered a job and needs to move to take it up, they must be able to demonstrate to the local authority’s satisfaction that they have a genuine intention to take up the</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities may wish to ask to see a letter of acceptance and may wish to contact the employer to verify the position. Authorities may also wish to seek clarification from the tenant by interviewing them over the telephone or in</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Verification and evidence</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities will want to satisfy themselves that the work or job-offer is genuine and should seek appropriate documentary</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Appropriate evidence could include:</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>a contract of employment</li><li>wage/salary slips covering a certain period of time, or bank statements (this is likely to be particularly relevant in the case of zero-hours contracts)</li><li>tax and benefits information – eg proof that the applicant is in receipt of working tax credit (if eligible)</li><li>a formal offer letter</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Additionally, local authorities may wish to contact the employer to verify the</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Authorities are strongly advised to consider whether an applicant qualifies for an allocation under the qualification regulations 2015 both at the time of the initial application and when considering making an</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h1>Prioritisation</h1>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The qualification regulations will ensure that tenants who need to move between local authority districts for work related reasons are not disadvantaged by a local connection test. However, to deliver the Right to Move, it is also important that tenants who need to move for work, within or across local authority boundaries, are given appropriate priority under local authorities’ allocation schemes.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hardship reasonable preference</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Section 166A(3) provides that housing authorities must frame their allocation scheme to ensure that reasonable preference is given to people who need to move to a particular locality in the authority’s district, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or others).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Paragraph 4.11 of the 2012 guidance sets out the Secretary of State’s view that ‘hardship’ would include, for example, a person who needs to move to a different locality to take up a particular employment, education or training opportunity.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>This guidance goes further and strongly encourages all local authorities to apply the hardship reasonable preference category to tenants who are seeking to transfer and who need to move within the local authority district or from another local authority district to be closer to work, or to take up an offer of</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In considering whether a transferring tenant needs to move for work related reasons to avoid hardship to themselves (or others), they may wish to take account of the guidance set out in paragraphs 16 to 34</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Where a tenant is seeking to move within the same local authority district, local authorities are encouraged to take a more flexible approach. This is because the tenant is already accommodated in the district and any move to another social home will therefore be broadly stock neutral (that is to say the transfer creates another void which can be used to meet other housing needs). In particular, local authorities should consider whether or not the issue of whether work is short-term, marginal, ancillary or voluntary carries the same weight in relation to a within district</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Setting aside a proportion of lets for cross-boundary moves</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In framing their allocation scheme to determine their allocation priorities, local authorities will wish to strike a balance between the interests of transferring tenants who need to move into their district for work related reasons and the demand from other applicants in identified housing</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The Secretary of State considers that an appropriate way to do so would be for a local authority to set a quota for the proportion of properties that it expects to allocate each year to transferring tenants who need to move into</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>their district for work related reasons (‘the Right to Move quota’). The Secretary of State strongly encourages all local authorities to adopt such an approach and considers that an appropriate quota would be at least 1%.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities should publish the quota as part of their allocation scheme, together with their rationale for adopting the specific percentage. They should review and revise the proportion as appropriate, in the light of changing</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities may wish to set aside a higher proportion than 1%. Authorities that decide to set a quota that is lower than 1%, should be ready to explain publicly why they have chosen to do</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It is important that local authorities are open and accountable, to their own tenants and the wider community as well as to tenants seeking to move into the area for work related reasons. Accordingly, local authorities are encouraged to report locally on demand for and lettings outcomes in relation to the Right to Move</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Area based choice based lettings schemes</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>We consider that such schemes provide an excellent basis for cross- boundary mobility, particularly as housing and employment markets are likely to be similar across the partner authorities. Accordingly, we strongly encourage all local authorities that participate in area-based choice based lettings schemes to consider how they can provide for tenants to move between partner authorities for work related reasons, for example, by providing for a quota of lettings to be made available for this</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>We are aware that in some parts of the country, local authorities participate in area based choice based lettings schemes that bring together a number of authorities and Private Registered Providers of social housing, often with a common allocation policy that applies to all the partner local authorities.</li></ol>\n",

Ask the Probation Service about any restrictions that apply to you.</p>\n<h2>If you are homeless or at risk of homelessness</h2>\n<p>If you have already left prison and are homeless or threatened with homelessness you should get in touch with the Homeless Prevention Service.</p>\n<p>We will assess your situation and work with you to create a personalised housing plan which will include your housing options.</p>\n<p>If you are working with the Probation Service, Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) or the youth offending team we will, with your consent, invite them to be part of this process. Your Probation Officer/Youth Offending Officer may have actions to help you move forward.</p>\n<h2>Emergency Accommodation</h2>\n<p>You may be entitled to emergency accommodation if we assess you as being in priority need. You will normally have a priority need if you, or someone in your household:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is pregnant</li>\n<li>has dependent children who normally live with you</li>\n<li>has been made homeless by an emergency such as flood or fire</li>\n<li>is vulnerable as a result of any physical/mental conditions or learning disability</li>\n<li>is vulnerable as a result of having served a custodial sentence or having been remanded in custody</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will make enquiries (with your consent) to see if you are vulnerable as a result of your period in custody. We look at the time served in custody/ detention, any support you receive from probation services/youth offending team, the time since you were released, if you have been able to secure and<br />\nmaintain accommodation during that time and your support networks (and how much of a positive influence your support networks are to you).</p>\n<h2>Your housing options</h2>\n<p>We will discuss options that are appropriate for you and your household. The demand for all forms of housing in Reading is very high therefore you should explore all options available to you. These may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/private-renting/\">Private rented accommodation</a> &#8211; you should consider the size and type of accommodation you need for your household and how much rent you can afford. Most landlords will ask for a cash deposit (in case you fail to pay your rent or cause damage to their property).<br />\nIf you don&#8217;t have a deposit we may be able to help either through the Rent Guarantee Scheme <span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">or by lending you the money to pay a cash deposit direct to your landlord.</span></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/rent-guarantee-scheme-rgs/\">Rent Guarantee Scheme</a> (RGS) &#8211; this scheme helps households on low incomes into private rented accommodation. We pay the rent to your landlord and provide a deposit guarantee (instead of a cash deposit).

You usually need a local connection to be eligible for Homechoice. As a prison leaver you are unlikely to have lived in the Borough for three consecutive years before you apply, but you may acquire a local connection by exception.</li>\n<li>Referral for supported accommodation &#8211; this depends on your needs and whether you have lived on your own before.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Local Housing Allowance (LHA)</h2>\n<p>If you are working and on a low income or if you claim welfare benefits you may be eligible for <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/housing-benefit-and-council-tax-support/\">Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support</a> or <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/discretionary-housing-council-tax-support-payments/universal-credit/\">Universal Credit</a> to help towards your rent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-housing-allowance\">LHA</a> limits the amount of benefit/credit you could get towards your rent based on the number of bedrooms your household is eligible for. If you are over 25, single, have left prison and are managed under the multi – agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) then the shared accommodation rate should not apply to you so you will be entitled to the 1 bed rate.</p>\n<h2>Contact the Homeless Prevention Service</h2>\n<p>We are open Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm. You will initially be seen by a Housing Advice Support Officer who will then allocate your case to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a Homeless Prevention Officer if you are threatened with homelessness within 56 days or are immediately homeless</li>\n<li>to a Homeless Resolution and Enablement Officer if you are still in accommodation but you are worried about becoming homeless in the future</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Call: 0118 937 2165 (office hours)<br />\nEmail: Housingadvice@reading.gov.uk<br />\nDrop-in Civic Offices, Bridge Street, Reading RG1 2LU</p>\n",

Your plan may also include actions for your personal adviser to help you move forward.</p>\n<p>Your plan may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A referral to supported accommodation: If you aren’t yet ready to live independently we can refer you to the YMCA who will assess you to see if they can offer you accommodation with the support you need to develop the emotional and practical skills you need to manage a tenancy and look after yourself effectively.</li>\n<li>Support to help you find private rented accommodation and help you with a cash deposit</li>\n<li>Support to apply for the <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/rgs\">Rent Guarantee Scheme</a> which can help you access private rented accommodation.

You must pay your rent to us and save towards your own deposit.</li>\n<li>Support to apply to <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice\">Homechoice</a> (Reading’s Housing Register for social housing). If you are between 18 and 21years (up to 25 if you are in full time education) and the Care Leavers Team at Reading and the Voids and Lettings Team agree that you have the skills to maintain a property, manage a tenancy and look after yourself effectively you will be given an elevated banding which gives you higher priority for housing. You still have to bid for properties. We may agree this even if you need some support to live independently.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Help with housing costs</h2>\n<p>Once you are 18 you are entitled to claim benefits. If you are working and on a low income or if you claim welfare benefits you may be eligible for Housing Benefit or Universal Credit to help towards your rent. You may also be eligible for Council Tax Support. Use <a href=\"https://becs.reading.gov.uk/\">our online calculator</a> to check your<br />\nentitlement.</p>\n<p>You should check the <a href=\"http://www.entitledto.co.uk\">Entitledto website</a> to see if you could claim any other benefits.</p>\n<h3>The Local Housing Allowance (LHA)</h3>\n<p>LHA limits the amount of benefit/credit you could get towards your rent based on the number of bedrooms your household is eligible for. Usually if you are single and under the age of 35 you only qualify for the shared accommodation rate. However if you have been in care, this does not apply to you until you turn 22.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared accommodation £81.14/week or £351.61/month</li>\n<li>1 bedroom £153.02/week or £663.08/month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children’s Services are responsible for paying rent and providing other financial support to 16 and 17 year old care leavers until they are old enough to claim benefits .</p>\n<h2>Local connection</h2>\n<p>To qualify for help from Reading Borough Council you must have a local connection to Reading.</p>\n<p>You have a local connection if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are owed leaving care duties by Reading’s children’s services or</li>\n<li>you are a care leaver under the age of 21 and you are owed leaving care duties by another local authority and while you were in care you were placed outside their area and spent at least two years living in Reading including some time before you turned 16.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are unsure where your local connection is contact the Homeless Prevention Service.</p>\n<h2>If you become homeless after leaving care</h2>\n<p>The help you get depends upon your age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under 18 years: Children’s Services are responsible for finding you somewhere to live. They will carry out a joint assessment with the Homeless Prevention Service to look at your options.</li>\n<li>18 years to your 21st birthday: You can get support from both After Care Services and from the Homeless Prevention Service. If you were in care between the ages of 16 or 17 (even if you don’t qualify for after care services from a children’s services authority) we will assess you as being in priority need and provide you with emergency accommodation. If you are in full time education your After Care Service must find you somewhere to live during holidays (if you need<br />\nit).</li>\n<li>Over 21 years: We may offer emergency accommodation if we assess you as being in priority need. We will consider:\n<ul>\n<li>how long you were looked after, accommodated or fostered for</li>\n<li>whether or not you have had a stable home since you left care</li>\n<li>if you have slept on the streets in the past</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are between 18 and 24 years and you tell us that you are a care leaver we will contact the children’s services authority responsible for you as soon as possible – we need your consent for this.</p>\n<h3>Contact the Homeless Prevention Service</h3>\n<p>We are open Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm. You will initially be seen by a Housing Advice Support Officer who will then allocate your case to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a Homeless Prevention Officer if you are threatened with homelessness within 56 days or are immediately homeless</li>\n<li>a Homeless Resolution and Enablement Officer if you are still in accommodation but you are <span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">worried about becoming homeless in the future</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Call: 0118 937 2165 (office hours)<br />\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:Housingadvice@reading.gov.uk\">Housingadvice@reading.gov.uk</a><br />\nDrop-in: Civic Offices, Bridge Street, Reading RG1 2LU</p>\n<p>This information can be provided in alternative formats (Braille, audio, large print) and other languages on request.</p>\n",

Payment</h2>\n<p>2.1 There is an annual non-refundable collection charge of £60 per annum for a maximum of two garden waste bins and £20 for a maximum of two garden waste bags.  The collection of one garden waste bin plus one garden waste bag will be charged at £60 per annum.</p>\n<p>2.2 Residents joining the collection scheme part way through the collection year will pay the following pro-rata charges:</p>\n<p>Green bins:<br />\nUp to &amp; including 30th June &#8211; £60<br />\n1st July to 30th September &#8211; £45<br />\n1st October to 31st December &#8211; £30<br />\n1st January to 31st March (from January 2018) &#8211; £15</p>\n<p>Green bags:<br />\nUp to &amp; including 30th June &#8211; £20<br />\n1st July to 30th September &#8211; £15<br />\n1st October to 31st December &#8211; £10<br />\n1st January to 31st March (from January 2018) &#8211; £5</p>\n<p>2.3 Reduced charges are available to residents in receipt of Council Tax Support.</p>\n<p>2.4 Payment is required annually in advance.  Failure to pay the full annual charge for the service will automatically result in the service ending without notice.</p>\n<p>2.5 Payment can be made online or via telephone by debit or credit card.</p>\n<p>2.6 The garden waste charges will be reviewed annually.</p>\n<p>2.7 No refunds will be issued if a resident moves out of the borough or if they stop using the service part way through the collection year.</p>\n<p>2.8 The resident has 14 working days from receipt of payment to notify the Council that they wish to cancel the service and will receive a full refund.</p>\n<p>2.8 These terms and conditions do not affect the resident&#8217;s statutory rights.</p>\n<h2>3. Green Waste Collection</h2>\n<p>3.1 Upon receipt of payment of the garden waste annual charge, the Council will issue a sticker to the resident that should be placed on the back of the bin just underneath the handles. Green waste bins will not be collected unless they have a sticker provided by the Council in place. A sticker will also be provided for green waste bags which should be attached to the front of the bag.  Failure to display the correct sticker will result in the bin or bag not being emptied.</p>\n<p>3.2 All garden waste material must be placed loose in the containers, no plastic bags of any kind may be placed in them, and the lid must be closed for safety reasons.  Extra waste presented at the side of or on top of garden waste bins and bags will not be collected.</p>\n<p>3.3  If the garden waste is too compacted and will not come out of the. garden waste bin or bag when tipped, it will be the resident&#8217;s responsibility to loosen and/or remove the waste before the next scheduled collection.</p>\n<p>3.4 Green garden waste bins which are too heavy for the crew or the collection vehicle to handle will not be emptied and will need to be lightened by the resident before the next collection.</p>\n<p>3.5 Garden waste bins or bags containing items other than those stated at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/recycling\">www.reading.gov.uk/recycling </a>will not be emptied.</p>\n<p>3.6 We reserve the right to refuse to collect green waste bins.</p>\n<p>3.7 The council accepts no liability for bins/sacks used for any other purpose other than for the collection of garden waste. Residents use the garden waste bins/bags at their own risk.</p>\n<p>3.8 Garden waste bins or bags containing food waste (including fruit and vegetables from your garden) will not be emptied. It is the resident&#8217;s responsibility to remove the incorrect items and present the bin or bag for the next scheduled collection.</p>\n<p>3.9 Garden waste bins/bags must be presented at the curtilage of the property with the handles facing the road and away from the other grey and red bins by 7am on the morning of collection and returned to your property after collection. The Council will not return to properties that have not presented their garden waste containers on the correct day and time until the next scheduled collection day.</p>\n<p>3.10 Residents are responsible for ensuring that there are no parked cars belonging to their household or visitors which impede access for waste collection vehicles on collection day. If bins cannot be collected on the due day they will not be emptied until the next collection.<br />\nOnly containers that have been genuinely missed by the collection crew will be returned to before the next scheduled collection. Containers which have not been presented by the stipulated time will not be returned to. Missed bin reports will be verified by the crew records.</p>\n<p>3.11 We offer assisted collections to households with elderly and/or infirm residents who do not have an able bodied person in the household to present the bins at the kerbside.</p>\n<p>3.12 During cold spells, garden waste may freeze and prevent the Council from emptying the contents of your bin or bag. It may not be possible to fully empty your bin or bag until the next scheduled collection day when temperatures have risen. During periods of extreme/adverse weather the Council reserves the right to suspend collections. No subscription money will be refunded. Notice of this will be posted on our website.</p>\n<p>3.13 It is the resident&#8217;s responsibility for replacing lost, stolen or damaged garden waste bins or bags with the exception of any garden waste bins or bags which are lost or damaged as a result of the collection. These will be replaced free of charge.</p>\n<p>3.14 The Council reserves the right to amend the collection frequency and time of collections at any time and for any reason</p>\n<p>3.15 The Council will  not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of our obligations if the delay or failure results from events or circumstances outside our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, strikes, lock-outs, accidents, war, fire, extreme weather conditions or breakdown of plant or machinery.</p>\n<h2>4. Variation of Terms</h2>\n<p>4.1 We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at any time and without notification.</p>\n<h2>5. Data Protection</h2>\n<p>5.1 We will process your personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We will not share your personal data with third parties without your permission.

The revaluation will have effect from 1 April 2017, based on open market rental values from 1 April 2015.</p>\n<h3>What is revaluation?</h3>\n<p>The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) regularly reassess and update the rateable values of all business properties; usually every five years. This is called a Revaluation.</p>\n<p>A revaluation is done to maintain fairness in the system by redistributing the total amount payable in business rates and by reflecting changes in the property market. Revaluation does not raise extra revenue overall.</p>\n<p>For more information on the 2017 Revaluation, rateable values, and business rates visit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates\">https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates</a></p>\n<p>You can also estimate your business rates bill, including any small business rate relief that may apply.</p>\n<h2>Working from home or living above your place of work</h2>\n<p>If a property is used for both domestic and non-domestic purposes, we charge Council Tax and Business Rates. If you work from home, we may charge Business Rates for the part of the property you use for work. You will still have to pay Council Tax on the rest of the property. Please contact the Valuation Office Agency on 03000501501 or <a href=\"mailto:ratingsoutheast@voa.gsi.gov.uk\">ratingsoutheast@voa.gsi.gov.uk</a> for further information.</p>\n<h2>Reductions and Exemptions</h2>\n<h3>Exemptions</h3>\n<p>The following are exempt from Business Rates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agricultural land and buildings</li>\n<li>Fish farms</li>\n<li>Churches and places of worship</li>\n<li>Sewers</li>\n<li>Public parks</li>\n<li>Properties used for disabled people</li>\n<li>Moorings for boats</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reduced rates</h3>\n<p>Business rates could be reduced if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The property is empty or unused (exemption is granted for three months or six months if industrial)</li>\n<li>The property is occupied by a charity or non-profit organisation</li>\n<li>The property is partially occupied</li>\n<li>Hardship would occur is rates were not reduced</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think your rateable value is wrong or that your property should be exempt, download an appeal form from <a class=\" inlinelink id5660\" title=\"Rateable value of a business : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates\" rel=\"external noopener\">Valuation Office Agency website</a>.

If approved a permit will be issued which in turn can be exchanged for a scaffold/hoarding licence.</p>\n<p>1.3    The licence fee must be paid in full before any documentation is issued. A copy of the licence must be displayed in a weatherproof container on the scaffold/hoarding to which it applies, in such a position as to permit easily accessible viewing. The licence must be available on site when the scaffold/hoarding is being erected.</p>\n<p>1.4    No unauthorised advertising is permitted on any part of the temporary structure (see Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992).</p>\n<p>1.5    Any scaffold or hoarding erected without a licence is illegal and may result in the removal of the scaffolding/hoarding or the undertaking of legal action by Reading Borough Council.</p>\n<p>1.6    The design and construction of any scaffolding or hoarding is the full responsibility of the licensee and must take into account the need to resist abnormal wind or weather conditions.</p>\n<p>1.7    Any scaffold that does not comply with the requirements of the Head of Highways and Transport representative must be altered or dismantled at the contractor&#8217;s expense.</p>\n<p>1.8    All scaffolding erected above or on the public highway must be covered by suitability public indemnity insurance, with minimum cover of £10 million and evidence shall be provided of an adequate policy being in place.</p>\n<p>1.9    All queries for scaffolds permits and licences shall be made to Reading Borough Councils, Highways Section at 2-4 Darwin Close, Reading, RG2 0RB, Telephone 0118 937 2454.</p>\n<h2>2. SCAFFOLD STANDARDS</h2>\n<p>2.1     The design of any scaffold shall allow for the maximum pedestrian access and protection. To this end, footway scaffolds must span the full width of the footway and all clips within the footway area must be protected from the public using guards</p>\n<p>2.2     The outer line of standards, or any other projections, must be at a minimum of 450mm from the kerb edge. If this requirement cannot be met permission must be sought from The Head of Highways and Transport representative to adopt the requirements outlined in items 2.15-2.19.</p>\n<p>2.3     The inner line of standards must be tight to the face of the building at pavement level. Where cornices project from the building horizontal ladder beams should be introduced so that further lifts are offset. No standard shall be placed between the inner and outer lines.</p>\n<p>2.4     A clear headroom of 2600mm must be provided above all sections of the footway available for the general public to walk.</p>\n<p>2.5     Standards should be lit at all times with bulkhead lights at 3000mm centres, red when facing the carriageway, white when facing the footway (minimum wattage 60 watt GLS or equivalent), white lights are to be located at rear of the footway. Where scaffold is located near traffic signals, white lights will be required facing the carriageway.</p>\n<p>2.6     Scaffolding lighting must be in place and operational within 7 days of the scaffold commencing.</p>\n<p>2.7    Outer standards must be painted white to a minimum height of 2600mm.</p>\n<p>2.8    Any scaffold or auxiliary structure which projects closer than 450mm to the face of the kerb edge or baulk timber must have a minimum clear headroom of 5030mm over the carriageway.</p>\n<p>2.9     Where scaffolding is provided adjacent to the kerb edge there should be gaps of at least 1500mm in width at regular longitudinal intervals in any horizontal scaffold or hoarding.</p>\n<p>2.10    All scaffold boards or any loose or lightweight material must be securely enclosed within, or fixed to, the scaffold structure.</p>\n<p>2.11    All site hutting must be kept within the site perimeter and will not be permitted to oversail the public footway or carriageway.</p>\n<p>2.12     Where scaffolding is permitted to span across the carriageway a clear headroom of 5030mm must be achieved and the occupiers of any affected property must be consulted and their permission obtained.</p>\n<p>2.13    Where scaffolds span the highway, the appropriate permissions must be in place to allow the road or footway to be closed.</p>\n<p>2.14    All scaffolds must have a fan above 5030mm unless agreed with the Head of Highways and Transport representative. Fans must be double boarded and sheeted, and set at 30˚ from the horizontal. Fans must be in place while all works take place above this level.</p>\n<p>2.15     300mm x 300mm baulk timbers will be required, for protection, to be set in the carriageway adjacent to the scaffold standards.</p>\n<p><strong>The following requirements are applicable where a minimum clearance from the kerb face cannot be provided.</strong></p>\n<p>2.16    Baulks to be painted red and white and rigidly fixed together and braced 100mm from the kerb face.</p>\n<p>2.17    Baulks to have red warning lights lit at all times and spaced at 3000mm intervals  (Minimum wattage 60 watt GLS or equivalent).</p>\n<p>2.18     Whenever baulk timbers are to be laid in the channel access to gullies and associated covers must be maintained.</p>\n<p>2.19     Where gaps are required in the outer scaffold corresponding gaps are to be made in the baulk timbers.</p>\n<h2>3. ERECTION OF SCAFFOLD</h2>\n<p>3.1     The erection of the first lift of any scaffolding is to be undertaken outside of peak hours between 9.30hrs and 15.30hrs Monday to Friday or at the discretion of the Head of Highways and Transport representative if the scaffold is to be erected on a classified road. N.B. These rules equally apply to the dismantling of scaffolding. During these times traffic flow should be maintained and no obstruction of the carriageway will be allowed, unless by that covered in 3.4.</p>\n<p>3.2     To prevent danger to contractors and the public, HSE Regulation 8 on falling objects states that suitable and sufficient steps must be taken to prevent the fall of any material or object from a scaffold. It also states that equipment must be stored safely to prevent danger arising from its collapse, overturning or unintentional movement.</p>\n<p>3.3     The first lift must be double boarded and contain a sheet between each layer of boards. Similarly all fans above the highway should be double boarded and sheeted.</p>\n<p>3.4     Above the first lift all scaffold must be handled directly from and to the lorry. If the lorry is parked on the highway, adequate traffic management should be erected, to the satisfaction of the Head of Highways and Transport representative. The traffic management shall ensure that delays to all road users, especially buses are kept to the minimum. If an articulated vehicle is used then the trailer must not be uncoupled from the tractor unit. Failure to provide adequate pedestrian and traffic management will result in suspension of the operations by the Head of Highways and Transport representative.</p>\n<p>3.5     No scaffold tubes, boards or associated fittings may be stored on the public footway or carriageway during erection or dismantling.</p>\n<p>3.6     Scaffold clips or any other scaffolding materials must not be thrown to or from the scaffold during erection or dismantling.</p>\n<p>3.7    Provision must be made for a safe pedestrian thoroughfare while the erection/dismantling of scaffolding takes place.</p>\n<p>3.8    All couplings below 2600mm shall be fixed so as to keep projecting threaded or clamp fixings on the opposite side to the main pedestrian route.</p>\n<p>3.9     All horizontal scaffold tubes below a height of 2600mm must be fitted with plastic end caps or otherwise made safe to the satisfaction of the Head of Highways and Transport representative.</p>\n<p>3.10     No scaffolding shall be attached to guard rails or any other street furniture.</p>\n<p>3.11    All protective sheeting and netting must be securely attached to the scaffolding, be able to withstand abnormal wind loads, and be maintained in a satisfactory condition.</p>\n<p>3.12    Whenever there is the possibility of street lighting being obscured or removed arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative for alternative lighting to be made (tel:0118 937 2113). A minimum notice of 28 days is required for the removal or adjustment of any light fittings. All costs will be borne by the scaffold licensee.</p>\n<p>3.14     Whenever there is the possibility of traffic signs, traffic signals or street name plates being obscured, or removed, arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative for alternative arrangements to be made. All costs will be borne by the scaffold licensee.</p>\n<p>3.15     Whenever there is a possibility of fire hydrants, utility covers, sewer entrances being obstructed arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative (tel. 0118 937 2454) to ensure that they are accessible at all times.</p>\n<p>3.16     In general, scaffold towers (mobile scaffolds and the like) will not be permitted on the public highway in the central area and on classified roads between 7am to 8pm, Monday to Saturday (excepting Bank Holidays) and 10am to 5pm on Sundays and Bank Holidays</p>\n<p>3.17     All scaffolding that is erected in the town is to be fit for its purpose and must comply with the requirements of the relevant legislation, including the following British Standards and Euro Code: BS5973, 1990 and July and August 1991; BS2482, 1981 and 1990; BS1139, pts 1 -5; EN39, 1976; BS5974, 1990 and July 1992; Construction (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1996; Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 1994, together with any subsequent amendments and/or additions.</p>\n<p>3.18    The requirements in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.17 equally apply for the removal of scaffolding from the Public Highway.</p>\n<h2>4. HOARDINGS</h2>\n<p>4.1     Hoardings shall be 2440mm high, rigidly constructed of smooth close-boarded timber. Other material may only be used if specifically approved by the Head of Highways and Transport representative.</p>\n<p>4.2     Hoardings shall be painted in a colour to be approved by the Head of Highways and Transport representative and kept in clean and safe condition.</p>\n<p>4.3     Hoardings must be lit at all times with bulkhead lights fixed to the top of the hoarding at 3000mm centres, red when facing the carriageway, white when facing the footway (Minimum wattage 60 watt GLS or equivalent). Lighting must be in place and operational within 7 days of the hoarding commencing.</p>\n<p>4.4     All access doors to be fixed so as not to open out over the footway.</p>\n<p>4.5     Whenever a scaffold is to remain in situ for more than 28 days the outside line of then scaffolding shall be boxed in with a 1200mm high hoarding. The top of this box must be covered and sloped at an angle of 45˚towards the carriageway. This requirement may be relaxed if the width of the footway is restricted.</p>\n<p>4.6    Whenever there is a possibility of fire hydrants, utility covers, sewer entrances, traffic control cabinets, traffic counters or any other street furniture being obstructed arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative (tel. 0118 937 2454), to ensure that they are accessible at all times.</p>\n<p>4.7    If it is permitted for a hoarding to enclose the footway then it should be set back a minimum of 450mm from the kerb edge. Should it not be possible to achieve this dimension then the requirements of paragraphs 2.15 to 2.19 would apply.</p>\n<p>4.8     All temporary footways are to be constructed with adequate cross falls and arrangements made to ensure that they do not affect the highway drainage if they extend into the carriageway.

    "content": "<h2>Lotteries</h2>\n<p>In essence a lottery is an arrangement which satisfies the statutory description of either a simple lottery or a complex lottery, as per section 14 of the Gambling Act 2005 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;).</p>\n<p>An arrangement is a simple lottery if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persons are required to pay to participate;</li>\n<li>one or more prizes are allocated to one or more members of a class; and</li>\n<li>the prizes are allocated by a process which relies wholly on chance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An arrangement is a complex lottery if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persons are required to pay to participate;</li>\n<li>one or more prizes are allocated to one or more members of a class;</li>\n<li>the prizes are allocated by a series of processes; and</li>\n<li>the first of those processes relies wholly on chance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arrangements that fulfil all of the criteria of either of the above categories are defined as a lottery under the Act.</p>\n<h2>Societies</h2>\n<p>Section 19 of the Act defines a society as such if it is established and conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for charitable purposes;</li>\n<li>for the purpose of enabling participation in, or of supporting, sport, athletics or a cultural activity; or</li>\n<li>any other non-commercial purpose other than that of private gain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is inherent in this definition that the society must have been established for one of the permitted purposes, and that the proceeds of any lottery must be devoted to those purposes. It is not permissible to establish a society whose sole purpose is to facilitate lotteries &#8211; it must have some other purpose.</p>\n<h2>Small Lottery under the Act</h2>\n<p>The Act defines a small society lottery with the definition breaking down into two distinct areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>society status &#8211; the society in question must be &#8216;non-commercial&#8217; (per &#8220;Definition of Society&#8221; as outlined at 2. above).</li>\n<li>size of lottery &#8211; the total value of tickets to be put on sale per single lottery must be £20,000 or less, or the aggregate value of tickets to be put on sale for all their lotteries in a calendar year must not exceed £250,000. If the operator plans to exceed either of these values then they will be classed as a large lottery operator, and must be licensed with the Gambling Commission (&#8220;the Commission&#8221;) instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The promoting society of a small society lottery must, throughout the period during which the lottery is promoted, be registered with a licensing authority.  The licensing authority with which a small society lottery is required to register must be in the area where their principal office is located. If a licensing authority believes that a society&#8217;s principal office is situated in another area, it should inform the society and the other authority as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Limits placed on small society lotteries</h2>\n<p>The limits are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>at least 20% of the lottery proceeds must be applied to the purposes of the society (schedule 11, paragraph 33);</li>\n<li>no single prize may be worth more than £25,000 (schedule 11, paragraph 34);</li>\n<li>rollovers between lotteries are only permitted where every lottery affected is also a small society lottery promoted by the same society, and the maximum single prize is £25,000 (schedule 11, paragraph 35); and</li>\n<li>every ticket in the lottery must cost the same and the ticket fee must be paid to the society (i.e. the society must take payment) before entry into the draw is allowed. (schedule 11, paragraph 37).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes between the Act and the old Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976</h2>\n<p>The Act introduces some relaxation of society lottery law and in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>removes the individual limits on the percentage of proceeds that may be applied to expenses or prizes — although the maximum global amount that can be deducted for expenses and prizes remains at 80%, with a minimum of 20% going to the purposes of the society or to local authority expenditure;</li>\n<li>allows rollovers of prize funds from one lottery to another promoted by the same society, provided the maximum single prize does not exceed £25,000 or 10% of the gross proceeds;</li>\n<li>permits the sale of tickets by an automated process; and</li>\n<li>removes the £2 maximum limit on ticket prices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complying with the regulations under the Act</h2>\n<p>As the purpose of permitted lotteries is to raise money for non-commercial causes, the Act requires that a minimum proportion of the money raised by the lottery is channelled to the goals of the society that promoted the lottery.  If a small society lottery does not acquiesce with these limits then it will be in breach of the Act&#8217;s provisions, and consequently be liable for prosecution (see &amp; above for details of limits).</p>\n<p>Paragraph 39 of Schedule 11 in the Act sets out the information that the promoting society of a small society lottery must send as returns to the licensing authority with which it is registered, following each lottery held.  This information will allow us to assess, in particular, whether financial limits are being adhered to and to ensure that any money raised is being applied for the proper purpose. The information that must be submitted is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the arrangements for the lottery &#8211; specifically the date on which tickets were available for sale or supply, the dates of any draw and the value of prizes, including any donated prizes and any rollover;</li>\n<li>the proceeds of the lottery;</li>\n<li>the amounts deducted by the promoters of the lottery in providing prizes, including prizes in accordance with any rollovers;</li>\n<li>the amounts deducted by the promoters of the lottery in respect of costs incurred in organising the lottery;</li>\n<li>whether any expenses incurred in connection with the lottery were not paid for by deduction form the proceeds, and, if so, the amount of expenses and the sources from which they were paid; and</li>\n<li>the amount applied to the purpose for which the promoting society is conducted (this must be at least 20% of the proceeds).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paragraph 39 of the Act also requires that returns must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>be sent to us no later than three months after the date of the lottery draw, or in the case of instant lotteries (scratch cards) within three months of the last date on which tickets were on sale; and</li>\n<li>be signed (electronic signatures are acceptable if the return is sent electronically) by two members of the society, who must be aged eighteen or older, are appointed for the purpose in writing by the society or, if it has one, its governing body, and accompanied by a copy of their letter or letters of appointment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Refusing a Lottery registration</h2>\n<p>We will refuse an application for any of the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an operating licence held by the applicant for registration has been revoked or an application for an operating licence made by the applicant for registration has been refused, within the past 5 years.</li>\n<li>the society in question cannot be deemed non-commercial.</li>\n<li>a person who will or may be connected with the promotion of the lottery has been convicted of a relevant offence.</li>\n<li>information provided in or with the application for registration is found to be false or misleading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, we may only refuse an application for registration after the society has had the opportunity to make representations against the refusal. These can be taken at a formal hearing or taken via correspondence. We will inform the society of the reasons why we are minded to refuse registration and will provide it with at least an outline of the evidence on which we have reached that preliminary conclusion — in order to enable it to make any representations it sees fit.</p>\n<p>The applicant or society may decide to make an appeal against the decision. They must lodge an appeal within 21 days of receipt of the notice of the decision, and this must be made directly to the local magistrates&#8217; court.</p>\n<h2>Regulations concerning lottery tickets</h2>\n<p>Lotteries may involve the issuing of physical or virtual tickets to participants (a virtual ticket being non-physical, for example in the form of an email or text message).  Schedule 11(36) requires that a purchaser of a small society lottery ticket must receive a document which identifies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the name of the promoting society;</li>\n<li>the price of the ticket (must be the same for all tickets);</li>\n<li>the name and address of the member of the society who is designated as having responsibility at the society for promoting small lotteries, or (if there is one) the external lottery manager; and</li>\n<li>the date of the draw, or enables the date to be determined.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the requirement to provide this information can be satisfied by providing an opportunity for the participant to retain the message electronically or print it.</p>\n<p>The Act requires that lottery tickets may only be sold by persons over the age of 16 to persons over the age of 16.</p>\n<p>Tickets should not be sold in a street, (street including any bridge, road, lane, footway, subway, square, court or passage &#8211; including passages through enclosed premises such as shopping malls); however, tickets may be sold from a kiosk, in a shop or door-to-door.</p>\n<h2>Regulations concerning prizes</h2>\n<p>Prizes awarded in small society lotteries can be either cash or non-monetary. However the amount of money deducted from the proceeds of the lottery to cover prizes must not exceed the limits set out by the Act &#8211; i.e. that combined with any expenses incurred with the running of the lottery, such as manager&#8217;s fees, they must not comprise more than 80% of the total proceeds of the lottery. Donated prizes would not be counted as part of this 80% (as no money would be withdrawn from the proceeds to cover their purchase) but should still be declared on the return following the lottery draw (see 6. above).</p>\n<h2>Offences applicable to Lotteries under the Act</h2>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table summary=\"Small lottery offences against the gambling act 2005\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Section of the Act</td>\n<td>Offence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol>\n<li>258</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>Promoting a non-exempt lottery without a licence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol>\n<li>259</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>Facilitating a non-exempt lottery without a licence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol>\n<li>260</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>Misusing the profits of a lottery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol>\n<li>261</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>Misusing the profits of an exempt lottery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol>\n<li>262</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>Purporting to operate a small society lottery when not registered, or failing to make the required, or making false or misleading, returns in respect of such lotteries.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol>\n<li>326</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>Without reasonable excuse, obstructing or failing to co-operate with an authorised person exercising his/her powers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol>\n<li>342</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>Without reasonable excuse, giving false or misleading information to the Commission or a licensing authority.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h2>Incidental &#8220;non commercial&#8221; lotteries</h2>\n<p>An incidental non-commerciaI lottery is one that is not promoted for private gain and which is incidental to a non-commercial event.  Examples may include a lottery held at a school fete, or at a social event such as a dinner dance. An event is deemed non-commercial if all the money raised at the event, including entrance fees, goes entirely to purposes that are not for private gain. Therefore a fundraising social event with an entrance fee would be non-commercial if the profits went to a society but would be commercial if the profits were retained by the organiser.</p>\n<p>For this type of lottery, part one of schedule 11 of the Act, and regulations laid by the regulations, specify the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The promoters of the lottery may not deduct more than £500 from the proceeds in respect of the cost of prizes.</li>\n<li>The promoters of the lottery may not deduct more than £100 from the proceeds in respect of the cost of other expenses, such as the cost of printing tickets or hire of equipment.</li>\n<li>The lottery cannot involve a rollover of prizes from one lottery to another.</li>\n<li>Tickets must only be sold at the premises during the event, and the result must be made public while the event takes place.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Annual fee</h2>\n<p>An annual fee must be paid within the period of two months which ends immediately before each anniversary of the registration.</p>\n",

Both centres are now closed.</p>\n<p>The Council is instead choosing to team up with a leisure provider and invest in modern new sport facilities. We are in the process of identifying a delivery partner through a detailed procurement process, which is ongoing.

The current timetable is that both new pools will be open for public use by 2020.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the Council is building a 25-metre 5-lane demountable pool at Rivermead (which is in addition to the existing swimming pool currently on the site). This is to provide an additional swimming facility pending the construction of the two new pools.

The regency white stuccoed grade II listed mansion (now a restaurant) is set on a hill at the highest point of the park. The park has broad sweeps of short cut grass, with areas of meadow grassland. An pond was created to the south of the house and attracts an assortment of wildlife, while &#8216;The Rookery&#8217; can be found to the north &#8211; a mature oak woodland and Wildlife Heritage Site.</p>\n<p>A favourite amongst children is the mini steam train, run by voluntary enthusiasts on the first Sunday of each month, near the Bath Road entrance. The site also features a wide variety of sports facilities and a well-equipped children&#8217;s play area. The park is also host to a number of annual events including the Reading Carnival and a steam fair.</p>\n<p>There is a management plan for Prospect Park, details of which can be found in our downloadable <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Prospect_Park_Management_Plan-1.pdf\">Prospect Park Management Plan</a> and <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Prospect_Park_Rookery_Management_Plan-1.pdf\">Prospect Park (Rookery) Management Plan</a> booklets.</p>\n",

A temporary bench has been installed by the new footpath at the south end of the playing fields. At the request of neighbours this bench will now be moved to further into the playing fields to avoid disturbance by persons in the late evenings. New benches will be installed along the new central footpath when it is installed next year.</p>\n<p>On the east side of the playing fields Agripower Ltd are continuing to strip and screen the topsoil of large stones and will be relaying the stone and then topsoil back onto this area to form a new playing surface. Agripower will also be forming the edges of the new playing area which will mean a small section of the heras fence moving very slightly to enable this part of the work to be done. In advance of this, Parks staff have removed some of the undergrowth along the fence line to keep pedestrian access open around the playing fields. The new soakaway has now been installed and once the screening and re-profiling works are complete the new drainage lines will be installed across this area during September and will include stone deliveries to back fill the drainage runs. We are looking to make these deliveries through the existing Mapledurham car park but this is dependent on Kier completing their works in the car park entrance road and the car park section to the playing fields. If their works are for some reason delayed then we will look to use the access route at the top of Hewett Avenue across footpath 43 for these deliveries until the car park entrance is available for access. This will mean the temporary closure of footpath 43 and a temporary traffic order on the bend of this road at those times when a delivery is made. We will look to keep these operations to a minimum.</p>\n<p>In September Agripower will also start to install the new play area as part of their works and this is to be located in the area at the north west of the site where their machinery is temporarily located. Neither the design nor location of play area is changed but it will be re-oriented (turned by 90<sup>0</sup>) to give more room between the football pitch to the west and the play area itself.</p>\n<p>We have been asked by neighbours about the orientation of the football pitches on the new playing area with possibly goal mouths backing onto neighbour&#8217;s gardens. Discussions are being held with Caversham Trent Football Club about this and they are taking a pragmatic approach to the orientation of the pitches and are listening to your concerns when they look at a layout of the pitches for the September 2020 football season.</p>\n<p>We have been asked when the pavilion refurbishment works will start. The actual construction work has been dependant on the £1.36m from the DfE which has now been received by the Trustees. In the interim a local architect has been appointed and initial design work started with community representatives. Detailed design work will now continue with a final design to be approved by Trustees. This work is dependent on all parties agreeing on the detailed pavilion design, planning approval and procuring a contractor within a short timeframe. If we receive the necessary approvals and have a contractor on board, we would look to start work in February 2020.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mapledurham_new_play_area_equipment.pdf\">Mapledurham new play area equipment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MPF_play_area_closure_notice.pdf\">MPF play area closure notice</a></p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council holds Mapledurham Playing Fields (MPF) in its capacity as charity trustee (&#8220;Trustee&#8221;) of the Charity. The Charity is registered with the Charity Commission.

A popular picnic site, the area features groups of mature trees and willow beds. However, the park is susceptible to flooding during the winter. The Coal woodland is at the eastern end of the Reading section of the Thames corridor, it is a wooded area raised out of the flood plain, and it starts immediately adjacent to the foot of Horseshoe Bridge at Kennet mouth. There is a towpath between the woodland and the river bank, and a small area of open space adjacent to the river which extends beyond the towpath and into the river. The woodland separates a Tesco superstore and car park from the river. In the northwest corner of the Kings Meadow is an old Victorian river-fed bathing station. Opposite this is an island and river lock, which is owned by the Environment Agency. The playing fields are used by football clubs throughout the season, although fixtures may be disrupted by flooding. In summer there is Gaelic football, and various events are staged throughout the year including Reading&#8217;s annual beer festival. Car parking is available in the south-west corner on Napier Road.</p>\n",

The gardens have recently undergone major restoration. They are located between the town centre and the ruins of the 11th century abbey, not far from Reading Station. The ornamental gardens have a wall around which provides a peaceful and tranquil retreat. There is a bandstand, and bands play every weekend in the summer. The Forbury Gardens is home to the famous Maiwand Lion statue. Although there are no formal children&#8217;s facilities, the gardens are wonderful for play, and the kiosk serves coffee, ice-creams and light lunches. The gardens have been entered for three national competitions, and have so far won a Green Flag Award every year since re-opening, along with annual accreditation as a Green Heritage Site, the BALI award and Best Regional Park in the Britain in Bloom competition.</p>\n",

The Holy Brook, which provided freshwater and power for the Abbey Mill, joins the canal at this point. Much of the waterside here is accessible. The history of the site is presented in the Story of Reading Gallery at nearby Reading Museum.</p>\n<p>The Ruins were fully conserved and interpreted in 2017-18 thanks to a £3.15m project supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund matched by a contribution from the Council. They reopen to the public on 16 June 2018. The Ruins host a wide variety of events including theatre, festivals and film, and are available for hire.</p>\n<p>You can find out more at: <a href=\"http://www.readingabbeyquarter.org.uk/\">www.readingabbeyquarter.org.uk</a>.</p>\n",

This permit is available 15 minutes before the ceremony and must be returned directly after the ceremony. The permit is collected from and returned to the Town Hall Reception. The driver will be required to leave their driving licence, vehicle keys or a returnable £20 cash deposit. Please note that a parking space in zone TC4 is not guaranteed. Please, consider alternative public parking arrangement, in case all TC4 spaces are occupied. There are numerous car parks across the town for use by your guests.</p>\n<h2>Booking a ceremony elsewhere in the Town Hall</h2>\n<p>If you would like exclusive use of a room (no ceremonies directly before and after, plus time to decorate and arrange the room) at the Town Hall for your wedding, please contact the Events team to check their availability. You will also need to book registrars to attend to conduct and register your wedding. Please note there is a fee for registrars to attend and register your wedding.</p>\n<h2>Music</h2>\n<p>The Register Office offers a range of classical music for weddings; however, you are welcome to bring your own music. As required by the marriage planner, please include your music selection, taking into consideration that religious music is not allowed in civil marriages.</p>\n<h2>Length of ceremony</h2>\n<p>Marriages in the Register Office&#8217;s ceremony room will take 15 to 20 minutes and we ask the couples and guests to arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled start.

You may wish to enter to music of your own choice.</p>\n<p>During the ceremony the Registrar will read out the declaratory words, followed by the contracting words you have chosen and you will be asked to repeat these in turn. If you are giving rings you will then be asked to exchange them and repeat any optional Ring Vows.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to appoint someone to deliver any <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/marriage-and-partnership-readings/\">readings</a> you have chosen (the Registrars cannot do this). You and your witnesses will then be asked to sign the marriage register, followed by the Registrar.</p>\n<p>Once the marriage has been registered we can issue certificates. However, please note that it may not always be possible to issue extra copies of the certificates to you on the day; if this is the case extra certificates will be sent out in the post or can be collected from the Register Office at a later date.</p>\n<p>There will be time at the end of the ceremony for photographs to be taken by your official photographer or guests.</p>\n<p>Please, note that we do not permit animals at ceremonies within the Reading Registration Service premises, except for registered assistance dogs. If an approved venue permits a couple to have animals or wildlife at the ceremony, the venue is entirely responsible for the health and safety of the guests and any housekeeping issues which may arise as a result.

    "title": "Memorial safety policy",
    "content": "<h2>1.0 Background</h2>\n<p>1.1 The Council has an overriding duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of the Cemeteries and Closed Churchyards for which it has responsibility, this includes the identification and control of hazards from unstable memorials.</p>\n<p>1.2 Through this policy and its actions the Council will seek to balance the risk of injury from unstable memorials with the sensitivities of carrying out works in the cemeteries and closed churchyards.</p>\n<p>1.3 This policy has been written having regard to the Special Report on &#8216;Memorial Safety in Local Authority Cemeteries&#8217; written by the Local Government Ombudsman published in March 2006 which gives advice and guidance to local authorities on this sensitive subject.</p>\n<h2>2.0 Risk Assessment, Inspection and Test</h2>\n<p>2.1 The council will risk assess and test memorials in accordance with the principles issued by the Institute of Cemeteries and Crematorium Management.</p>\n<p>2.2 All memorials will undergo a visual inspection. The inspection programme will be prioritised with attention directed at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Areas likely to contain significant numbers of unstable structures</li>\n<li>Crosses and larger structures which if unstable are likely to cause the most injury / damage</li>\n<li>Highly visited areas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.3 Memorials under 500mm will not undergo another test unless the visual inspection and positional risk assessment of the memorial gives rise to believe that further test is required, and it is considered safe to carry out a further test.</p>\n<p>2.4 Memorials over 500mm and up to 1.5m will undergo visual inspection, risk assessment and a hand test. A hand held testing device may be used when testing these memorials.</p>\n<p>2.5 Memorials above 1.5m will be visually inspected and risk assessed. If any further investigations are required they will be undertaken by a structural engineer.</p>\n<p>2.6 Records will be maintained relating to the inspection and consideration will be given to photographing the memorials.<br />\n2.7 Memorials will be subject to a re-inspection as part of a 5-year rolling programme.</p>\n<h2>3.0 Making Memorials Safe</h2>\n<p>3.1 Where an unstable memorial is identified the Council will either provide temporary support or place notices or if appropriate cordon the memorial. Cordoning is a temporary measure and will only happen in areas of the cemetery visited less frequently.</p>\n<p>3.2 Memorials will only be laid flat where this course of action is necessary to prevent a genuine hazard to health and safety that cannot be remedied or reduced to an acceptable level by temporary support or cordoning.</p>\n<p>3.3 If the memorial is to be repaired all works are to be carried out in accordance with the Council&#8217;s Memorial Safety Accreditation Scheme.</p>\n<h2>4.0 Action after Making Safe</h2>\n<p>4.1 The responsibility for maintaining a memorial in a safe condition is that of the grave owner. Where the grave owner cannot be traced and it is felt that the memorial has historic significance or its maintenance is important to preserve the character or ambience of the Cemetery, the Council will consider carrying out the repairs subject to funds being available.</p>\n<p>4.2 Where grave owners have been traced the options available to them will be discussed.</p>\n<p>4.3 Memorials, which have no historic significance, where the grave owner cannot be traced or family are not forth coming to resolve and where maintenance is not required to preserve the character or ambience of the cemetery, will be assessed and reviewed for further action. Further action may include digging a third of the stone into the ground, which is known as &#8216;socketing&#8217;, continued support, change to a monolith or respectfully laying the memorial flat within the grave space. This will be dependent on the location of the memorial within the cemetery and what is practical for the area and the safest option.</p>\n<h2>5.0 Provision of Information</h2>\n<p>5.1 The Council recognises that it is important to keep members of the public informed in advance of any memorial testing activity and will give public notice in advance of carrying out a general testing programme.</p>\n<p>5.2 Where records are available and considered to be in date the Council will notify individual grave owners that testing is to be carried out.</p>\n<p>5.3 The Council will notify individual grave owners, if known, when a memorial fails the test. The notification will detail what action the grave owner is required to organise and any action taken or proposed by the Council.</p>\n<p>5.4 Each memorial failing a test will have a notice placed on or near the memorial giving contact details and a period for contact.</p>\n<p>5.5 The Council will hold open days where the public will be invited and have the testing procedures explained and demonstrated.</p>\n<h2>6.0 Training</h2>\n<p>6.1 The Council will ensure that the Institute of Cemeteries and Crematorium Management or other suitable organisation will properly train all personnel carrying out testing.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Reading Crematorium is committed to the sensitive and respectful care of all of those entrusted to us. Our policies and processes for infant cremation are aligned to the latest guidance on Infant Cremation, as per the advice of Lord Bonomy&#8217;s Infant Cremation Commission (June 2014 Scotland). Full statement here: <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/06/8342/3\">http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/06/8342/3</a></p>\n<p>In accordance with this guidance, which is fully supported by the national representative bodies (the Federation of Burial and Cremation Authorities (FBCA), the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management (ICCM), the Cremation Society of Great Britain (CSGB) and the Association of Private Crematoria and Cemeteries (APCC)) our ashes policy is set out below:</p>\n<h2>Definition of ashes</h2>\n<p>In line with Lord Bonomy&#8217;s proposals, the crematorium believes cremated remains and ashes to be one and the same thing. This supports the commission&#8217;s definition that ashes are &#8220;all that is left in the cremator at the end of the cremation process, and following the removal of any metal.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Return of ashes</h2>\n<p>Our approach to the cremation of babies and infants is designed to maximise the recovery of ashes. This includes using a cremation tray to hold the ashes where possible, and care to reduce the loss of any ashes during the cremation.</p>\n<p>We will employ best practice, for example the use of specialist computer programmes and metal trays. Our staff will watch out for any need to adjust cremation procedures in order to protect the ashes and maximise their retrieval.</p>\n<p>We are confident that the equipment and processes adopted for infant cremation at Reading Crematorium maximise the likelihood of recovering ashes. In any rare instance of non-recovery of ashes, we will conduct a review of the cremation process within 48 hours to understand why this is the case. The results of this review will be documented and contain details of any adjustments of our procedure deemed to be necessary, and will be available to next of kin/parent(s) if they wish to view these. We will adhere to our identification procedure that guarantees that the ashes resulting from individual cremations returned to parents are those of their baby.</p>\n<h2>Shared cremations</h2>\n<p>Where a shared cremation has been authorised, meaning ashes are not individually identifiable, we will take the same care throughout the cremation process. This will include steps to maximise the recovery of ashes. We will scatter/bury the ashes within the crematorium&#8217;s designated area. The location will be recorded for future reference.</p>\n<h2>Disposal of ashes</h2>\n<p>Concerning disposal of ashes after a private cremation, the crematorium will only act on the written instruction of the parent who is the Applicant for Cremation or another person nominated in writing by the parent.</p>\n<p>In the case of shared cremations we will only act on the written instruction of the designated person at the relevant hospital, who is acting as the Applicant.</p>\n<p>Ashes will be held at the crematorium for up to 10 weeks to await collection by representatives or instructions as to their disposal. Where no further instructions have been received within the four week period, a further fourteen days&#8217; notice will be given in writing to the applicant. Once the fortnight has gone by, a final letter will be sent telling the representative that the ashes will be scattered within the grounds of the crematorium in 30 days if no further instructions have been received.</p>\n<h2>Disposal of metals</h2>\n<p>The applicant should give consent for disposal of metals recovered from an individual cremation and the applicant will be provided with information on the options available.</p>\n<h2>Record-keeping</h2>\n<p>All cremations of babies and infants will be registered at the crematorium. The information contained in forms and certificates will be retained indefinitely (this may be in electronic form).</p>\n<p>If ashes are scattered or buried within the grounds of the crematorium the final resting place will be recorded. Where ashes are to be collected, the details of any person authorised by the applicant to remove/collect the ashes, and the date on which the ashes were collected will be recorded.</p>\n<p>The policy of this Cremation Authority is designed to give an audit trail from initial funeral instructions to the final disposal of ashes (whether by collection from the crematorium or by scattering or burial in the Gardens of Remembrance).</p>\n<h2>Questions or queries</h2>\n<p>If you have any questions or queries about the cremation of your baby, you can speak a member<br />\nof the crematorium team.</p>\n",

The South Chapel is the larger and can accommodate 100 people seated. The West Chapel can accommodate 36 seated.</p>\n<p>The South Chapel is located at the end of the drive and the West Chapel to the left of the South Chapel. Both chapels are equipped with audio visual facilities allowing the personalisation of the service with selected music and or photographic tributes.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"memorialservice\"></a>Memorial service</h2>\n<p>A memorial service may be religious or non-religious and can take place any time after the funeral. It is separate from the funeral and provides a relaxed atmosphere where the departed can be remembered with fond words, music and anecdotes. There is no coffin or casket, however, you may bring the ashes in an urn or suitable container and make them the focus. A memorial service can be the perfect choice if people cannot attend the funeral in person allowing you flexibility in choosing a date when all can attend. Memorial services can be booked direct with the Crematorium (there is no need for a funeral director). Please make arrangements with a Minister of Religion or Celebrant to conduct the Memorial Service. Alternatively, family or friends may wish to say a few words at the service.</p>\n<p>Should you wish to arrange a memorial service, please <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/article/11223/Contact-us\">contact the crematorium office</a>.</p>\n<h2>Visits to chapels</h2>\n<p>We welcome visitors to view the chapels but please telephone in advance to book an appointment. We do have services throughout the day but will try our best to accommodate you.</p>\n<h2>Multi-faith</h2>\n<p>Both chapels may be adapted for religious ceremonies of differing faiths or can be used as a civil space for non-denominational funerals.</p>\n<h2>Civil celebrants</h2>\n<p>A civil celebrant will deliver a celebration of life centred on the person who died. Any music can be played at a civil service; the celebrant can add religious readings and music if required. A period of reflection can be added to the service where a moment for private prayer can be taken.</p>\n<h2>Humanist service</h2>\n<p>Humanist services are non-religious and are more focused on life. A humanist service will not include hymns, prayers or anything religious.</p>\n<h2>Webcasting</h2>\n<p>Obitus Webcasts allow absent family members and friends the opportunity to be a part of the service, without being physically present. Both of our chapels have the cameras installed to capture the service, this is then streamed live via a secure private link and recorded. Family members can share the secure link and password with whomever they choose.</p>\n<p>The service will be available to view &#8216;on demand&#8217; for up to 28 days after the service has taken place. All streamed services are recorded and available to purchase on DVD, Blu Ray or USB stick after the service has taken place.</p>\n<p><a class=\" inlinelink id6369\" title=\"Obitus webcasting : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"http://www.obitus.com/\" rel=\"external noopener\">Obitus website</a></p>\n<h2>Visual tributes</h2>\n<p>Photographic tributes are the perfect way to remember the life and times of loved ones. Obitus can provide a number of different photo options to be shown during the service the perfect way to trigger happy memories. Options include a single photograph shown throughout the service, a simple slideshow with up to 25 photos either played on a loop throughout the service or a professional photo tribute set to music of your choosing.</p>\n<h2>Family supplied video checking</h2>\n<p>The checking and preparation of a video supplied by the family or third party, played once at a time of your choosing. This service is optional and your Funeral Director will arrange it for you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"South Chapel\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/8373/South-Chapel/image/South_chapel2.jpg\" alt=\"South Chapel \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">South Chapel</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\" noborder\" title=\"West Chapel\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/8374/West-Chapel/image/crem-092.jpg\" alt=\"West Chapel \" /><br />\n<span class=\"strongtitle\">West Chapel</span></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-25\">\n<div id=\"areapanel\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

When transfers are needed these are carried out by contracted funeral directors who are suitably equipped and qualified to do so.</p>\n<p>Where police do not attend or a death is believed likely to be natural and/or expected, the deceased may be taken directly into the care of the family&#8217;s chosen funeral director. Should a later transfer to a mortuary be required, this will be arranged by the Coroner&#8217;s Office.</p>\n<h2>Initial inquiries</h2>\n<p>A Coroner&#8217;s Officer will initially contact the deceased&#8217;s registered GP in order to establish whether there is a medical cause of death. If the GP is able to provide a cause of death in their best believe and knowledge, they will issue an MCCD (Medical Certificate of Cause of Death). If the deceased has recently been admitted to hospital, then the Coroner&#8217;s Officer may also make contact with a treating doctor at the hospital to establish whether they may be able to issue a MCCD.</p>\n<p>If an MCCD is issued by a medical professional, the Coroner&#8217;s Office will authorise release of the deceased from the mortuary into the care of chosen funeral directors. Relatives can then register the death and proceed with funeral arrangements. There will be no further involvement from the Coroner&#8217;s Office.</p>\n<h2>Post mortems</h2>\n<p>If a cause of death cannot be established by a medical professional, the Coroner will authorise a post mortem examination. This examination will be carried out by a pathologist and it will take place at the hospital mortuary.</p>\n<h2>What happens after a post mortem?</h2>\n<p>A Coroner&#8217;s Officer will be in contact following the post mortem to advise on the cause of death.</p>\n<p>If the death is due to natural causes, the coroner will authorise release of the deceased. The coroner will also issue paperwork to the relevant register office. A family member will then be able to register the death and proceed with funeral arrangements. There will be no further involvement from the Coroner&#8217;s Office.</p>\n<p>If the cause of death is unnatural, there will need to be an inquest.</p>\n<h2>Inquests</h2>\n<p>Inquests are public hearings into the facts of someone&#8217;s passing. When an inquest is needed, the death cannot be registered at the register office. The Coroner&#8217;s Office will issue interim death certificates in this case, and these will enable families to start sorting out the deceased&#8217;s affairs. Families will be kept updated as to when the inquest will take place and will be invited to attend if they wish.</p>\n<h2>Will there be a delay in organising a funeral?</h2>\n<p>The Coroner&#8217;s Officer will advise when the deceased can be released to funeral directors. There should be no delay in organising a funeral. Once a post mortem has been carried out and any appropriate forms filled in, then the deceased can be released into the care of funeral directors.</p>\n<p>If there is going to be any delay in releasing the deceased, for instance when a death is due to any criminal proceedings, this will be made clear to family by the Coroner&#8217;s Officer.</p>\n<p><strong>More information can be found in the &#8216;Guide to Coroner Services&#8217;:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-coroner-services-and-coroner-investigations-a-short-guide\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-coroner-services-and-coroner-investigations-a-short-guide</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Red Route",
    "content": "<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Between 12th June 2017 and 21st July 2017, we invited informal feedback, to consider making a Red Route along the bus route number 17. A Red Route is a &#8216;no stopping&#8217; restriction which has worked well on major bus routes in London for many years. The Red Routes keep key public transport moving and prevent delays for bus passengers and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>\n<p>The scope of the proposal was to consider a combination of double-red and single-red lines to largely mirror the existing yellow-line controls and create a corridor &#8216;no-stopping&#8217; restriction. Existing parking and loading bays along the route were to be maintained and additional facilities provided, where possible.</p>\n<p>Double red lines will mean no vehicles can stop at any time, including to load or unload. There are some exceptions, such as hackney carriages, private hire vehicles and blue badge holders, who are allowed to stop to let passengers in and out. Single red lines will mean that drivers will be able to stop or park in accordance with the signed restriction.</p>\n<p>The red route restrictions can be enforced by CCTV cameras, enabling efficient management of unwanted stopping movements that disrupt traffic flow and create obstacles and hazards for cyclists and pedestrians.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>In September 2017, our Traffic Management Sub-Committee gave approval for this to be implemented as a test Traffic Regulation Order, which will be divided into 3 sections &#8211; West, East and Central.</p>\n<p>Promoting the scheme on an experimental Order allows for flexibility with the scheme, as it enables minor changes to be made to the restrictions once they are in place &#8211; it therefore allows us to shape the restriction to best meet local needs.</p>\n<p>After the initial 6 months of the test, the Sub-Committee will be required to consider any objections received and to decide whether or not to continue with the scheme. The experimental order can last for a maximum of 18 months.</p>\n<p>&#8216;The Eastern Corridor is complete, the Western Section is now being implemented with the Town Centre to shortly follow.</p>\n<h2>Information and Feedback</h2>\n<p>This webpage contains a number of documents to assist in understanding of the scheme and the detail of the Red Route restrictions. Detailed plans of the scheme will be added as each section is implemented.</p>\n<p>The innovative nature of this restriction means that we will be reviewing feedback over a minimum period of 6 months, following opening of the route. Your views are important to us and we&#8217;d be grateful to receive your feedback and any suggestions that you may have for local alterations to the scheme.</p>\n<p>Should you wish to comment, support or object to the restrictions, please do so by writing to <a href=\"mailto:highway.objections@reading.gov.uk\">highway.objections@reading.gov.uk</a>. Please include &#8216;Red Route &#8211; East&#8217;, &#8216;Red Route &#8211; West&#8217; or &#8216;Red Route &#8211; Centre&#8217; in the email subject line and provide the reasons for any objections to the scheme.</p>\n<h2>Red Route dispensations</h2>\n<p><a class=\" inlinelink id6655\" title=\"Red Route dispensation : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://self.reading.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-4e2f199b-8002-4ae4-9d03-e1aa11ef8346/AF-Stage-16d4d3f1-691d-4cb8-a7bf-3c7ca9f15c12/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes\" rel=\"external noopener\">Apply for a Red Route dispensation permit</a>.</p>\n",

No highway authority can prevent a statutory undertaker from carrying out its legal duty.</p>\n<p>The council&#8217;s role is to ensure disruption is minimised by co-ordinating roadworks and to ensure proper practice is applied during the works to maintain public safety.  It is the case that highway authorities may be involved at the planning stage, particularly on larger projects.  At this stage the highway authority will suggest ways to best accommodate the works, to avoid clashing with other works, and to limit the impact to residents and other road users.</p>\n<p>It is, however, the legal responsibility of the statutory undertaker to present its management plan which should take into account every aspect of the work.  This includes not just road-based traffic management, but also the safety of everyone, whether workers themselves, delivery of equipment and materials, removal of waste and the environmental impact through noise and dust for example. All aspects of the work is entirely the legal resposibility of the statutory undertaker and its contractors.</p>\n<p>Some requests by utility companies are of course easier to accommodate than others, depending in the nature of the work and its exact location.

It has a committed team of Shared Lives officers and carers who have been involved for several years.</p>\n<p>The scheme supports vulnerable adults by placing them with an approved &#8216;Shared Lives carer&#8217;, who takes them into their home, supports them and shares their everyday life with them. The support is flexible and the person is encouraged to live as independently as possible.</p>\n<p>We currently support adults with learning disabilities, older people, those with mental health needs and those with a physical disability.</p>\n<h2>Why carers are needed</h2>\n<p>Some adults may require support from others to take care of<br />\nthemselves and develop independent living skills because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>their family are no longer able to provide care and support in<br />\nthe family home</li>\n<li>the adult does not wish to continue living at home</li>\n<li>the adult wishes to leave residential accommodation</li>\n<li>the adult is no longer able to live independently</li>\n<li>there are risks of isolation and vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How Shared Lives works</h2>\n<p>The Shared Lives scheme works in a similar way to fostering. People are referred to the Shared Lives team at Reading Borough Council by social workers, voluntary organisations, GPs or self-refer.</p>\n<p>The Shared Lives team then proceed with a matching process, to match the user with a carer; this matching is by mutual agreement and both parties meet and choose one another, which helps to ensure the success of the scheme. The recruitment and matching of carers takes between three to five months; training is then completed by the carer.</p>\n<p>The person then moves in to the carer&#8217;s home, either full-time, part-time or for respite care. Whilst there, they share the home, community and family life with the carer and are supported to engage in activities to complement their care.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of the Shared Lives scheme</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared Lives consistently outperforms all other forms of regulated care in CQC inspections, at 96% good or excellent. The Reading Shared Lives service is currently rated &#8216;good&#8217;.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Shared Lives enables people to live life to the full in their community, without having to live alone or in a care home&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;People sometimes use a shared lives scheme as a way of learning the skills they need to live independently and to help them put down roots in the area or community before moving into a place of their own&#8221;</li>\n<li>Many participants of Shared Lives report of feeling settled, valued and like they belong for the first time in their lives. Many make more friends, get involved with activities and are able to go on holiday for the first time in their lives as a result of Shared Lives.</li>\n<li>Carers have said that the scheme is a life-enriching experience for them and immensely rewarding through the ability to make a difference to people&#8217;s lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Types of care</h2>\n<h3>Full-time carers</h3>\n<p>Our full-time carers welcome an adult who needs support into their home and families. They provide a stable home with the practical and emotional support the person needs to maximize their potential. This can include supporting them to develop independent living skills and take part in hobbies and social activities.</p>\n<p>Ideally you will have some experience of caring for adults and must be willing to make a long-term commitment. You must have a spare room.</p>\n<h3>Respite carers</h3>\n<p>Respite carers offer short term placements in their own home so you will need a spare room. It could be an overnight stay or a weekend, to the occasional week to enable full-time carers to take a break from their caring role. Sometimes respite carers take the person needing support on a short holiday.</p>\n<h3>Day support</h3>\n<p>If you do not have the space to have someone stay with you, you could help and support someone with activities such as shopping, going to the cinema, attending football matches or getting involved with the local community. It could be that you help them learn how to cook or manage their laundry.</p>\n<h2>Becoming a carer</h2>\n<p>Caring for an adult with support needs can be a very rewarding and yet challenging task. As a carer you would be expected to treat the person as a member of your own family, understand the particular difficulties they face and give them the support and care they need to help them be as independent as they possibly can. Being a carer could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing a home</li>\n<li>Being flexible</li>\n<li>Having patience</li>\n<li>Developing practical skills</li>\n<li>Encouraging social contact</li>\n<li>Building confidence</li>\n<li>Offering emotional support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Qualifications</h3>\n<p>You do not need a specific qualification when you apply to become a carer but you must be willing to work towards gaining a caring qualification (currently the Care Certifi cate, on induction). It is helpful if you have experience of being in a caring role, but this is not essential. It is more important that you have a caring attitude.</p>\n<h3>Training and development</h3>\n<p>As a Shared Lives Carer you will be expected to complete all mandatory training. This can be completed as class room based or online.</p>\n<p>If there is a change in the needs of the person you are supporting and you require training for this, the scheme will provide you with this training. You can discuss any training needs when your Shared Lives Officer visits.</p>\n<h3>Carers events</h3>\n<p>As part of the scheme’s registration, we hold two or three events each year that carers are required to attend. We occasionally invite speakers along to talk about subjects of particular interest to the group. These events are also opportunities to socialise and get to know other carers and for you to build on your support networks.</p>\n<h3>Financial support</h3>\n<p>You will be paid a fee for each adult you support. We can tell you current fees when you enquire or meet with a Shared Lives Officer. If you need special equipment for the adult you look after, this will be provided for you.</p>\n<h3>Your contract</h3>\n<p>Shared Lives carers are contracted on a self-employed basis. Full-time carers are paid a fixed amount for the care they provide. Respite and day support carers are paid based on sessions.</p>\n<h2>Support for carers</h2>\n<p>Our carers offer an essential service to adults who require support so it is important to us that you feel valued and supported when you take on this vital role. You won’t be on your own &#8211; you are part of a professional team working closely together to provide the care and support needed.</p>\n<p>The sort of support you can expect includes:</p>\n<h3>The Shared Lives Officer</h3>\n<p>The Shared Lives Officer is your main source of support. They will monitor the placement to make sure you are happy with how things are going and offer advice and support to help you deal with any issues that arise. They will carry out visits and reviews of the placement.</p>\n<p>You can contact the Shared Lives Scheme any time between office hours if you have anything you need or want to discuss.</p>\n<h3>Care manager</h3>\n<p>The person you support may have an allocated care manager you can make contact with, if not you can still contact the care management team if you have any concerns.</p>\n<h3>Out of hours/emergency duty team (EDT)</h3>\n<p>If you have any concerns outside of the Shared Lives Team’s normal working office hours then you can contact the EDT, who can offer you support and guidance.</p>\n<h2>Application process</h2>\n<h3>Home visits</h3>\n<p>We will visit you at home to discuss your application and get to know you. We will talk to you about your background, your way of life, your approach to adults with support needs. We will ask for three or four references and ask your permission to carry out checks which include health/GP references, DBS check and mortgage/rental landlord references.</p>\n<p>We will explain things you need to know and answer any questions. The Shared Lives Officer will write a report on your suitability as a carer to present to the Shared Lives Panel. You will have the opportunity to read the report.</p>\n<p>If at any stage during visits you feel that being a carer is not right for you please let us know. Equally if during our visits we have any concerns or worries, we will talk to you about them straight away.</p>\n<h3>Shared Lives Panel</h3>\n<p>The panel is made up of representatives from other local authorities, the private and voluntary sector and the NHS. The Shared Lives Officer will present their report and make recommendations to the panel. The panel will consider the information and make the decision about whether or not to accept you as a carer. If the Registered Manager does not agree with the<br />\npanel’s decision they are able to override the overall outcome.</p>\n<h2>Matching adults and carers</h2>\n<p>Once you are approved there may be a gap until an adult is matched with you. Once we find a match we can start the process with you.</p>\n<p>It is important that you get to know each other before either party makes a commitment. There is no set time for this – we always work at a pace that suits everyone involved and the type of care you have decided to offer.</p>\n<p>At the end of a trial period all parties have to decide if they want to go ahead with the placement.</p>\n<h3>Unsuccessful placements</h3>\n<p>Usually we know by the end of the trial period whether or not the match is going to be a success. Very occasionally placements don’t work – if either you or the adult in your care are not happy it is in everyone’s interest for us to make alternative arrangements. It is unusual for matches to fail – most are very successful. Carers often continue for many years because the role is so rewarding. Because a placement does not work out does not mean that we will not try to make another match with a different adult when someone is referred to the service. Sometimes it can take time to find a match.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/9865/image2/image/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\">Could you be a Shared Lives carer?</span></p>\n<h2>Contact the Shared Lives team</h2>\n<p><a class=\" inlinelink id6823\" title=\"Shared Lives carer form : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://reading-self.achieveservice.com/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-4b7f67dc-e17f-48f0-a8fe-6ca6c1f06687/AF-Stage-e9cce6ab-796c-4cbe-ae30-097f59b38096/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=/en&amp;cancelRedirectLink=/en\" rel=\"external noopener\">Online expression of interest form</a></p>\n<p>Telephone: 0118 937 3700</p>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:sharedlives@reading.gov.uk\">sharedlives@reading.gov.uk</a></p>\n",

In 2016 they announced that for the 3 years from 2017/18 to 2019/20 Councils would be allowed to increase this by up to 3% in any given year, but no more than 6% in total over those years. Reading Borough Council took the decision to increase the Adult Social Care Precept element of Council Tax by 3% in 2017/18 and 2018/19.  As a result, in 2019/20 the Adult Social Care Precept will increase by 0%.</p>\n<p>The Government has said that this precept must be shown as a separate charge on all council tax bills. The precept shown on the bills is for the precepts in 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19. There is no addition to the precept in 2019/20.</p>\n<h2>E-billing account troubleshooting</h2>\n<h3>&#8216;Invalid username / password supplied&#8217;</h3>\n<p>This means that the username and/or password entered does not match login details held on our database.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that your username and password are both case sensitive.

There are three 14-storey blocks of flats in Wensley Road, Reading, (RG1 6ED), and four eight-storey blocks in Granville Road, Southcote (RG30 3QD), with a total of 427 flats in these 7 blocks &#8211; as detailed below.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 280px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"Tower blocks\" width=\"591\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Block location</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No. of blocks</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Flats per block</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Height of blocks/storeys</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Wensley Rd</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>89</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>42 m high, 15 storey</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Granville Rd</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>40</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>22m high, 8 storey</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Cladding </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>No</strong>ne of these tower blocks use the same ACM (Aluminium Composite material) or plastic cladding that was used at Grenfell Tower.</p>\n<p>The cladding used in Reading&#8217;s tower blocks is external wall insulation with a cement render finish.</p>\n<p>None of our tower blocks use cladding panels. The Wensley Road tower blocks have external wall insulation and there are some areas that have cavities between the external insulation and the mainly concrete construction, but on the limited elevations where they do occur, fire breaks are in place to stop the spread of fire. None of the other flatted blocks have cavities.</p>\n<p>None of the blocks have undergone a refurbishment which would have included the use of cladding. Wensley Rd flats were constructed in 1960 in solid reinforced concrete (Wimpey No-fines)  and were externally insulated in the 1990&#8217;s. Granville Road flats were constructed in 1958 in solid reinforced concrete (Wimpey No fines) and were externally insulated in the late 1980&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>We have a good knowledge of our housing block construction types and have assessed the fire risk in respect of these.  The council would like to test all cladding materials to provide maximum safety assurance. The council has approached the BRE which is the body carrying out testing for the Government but the agency has stated that it is not currently prioritising testing of non-ACM panels.  </p>\n<h2>Fire escapes</h2>\n<p>There are two fire escapes fitted on each of the seven tower blocks in Reading.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fire safety measures</strong></h2>\n<p>The Coley high rise flats have fire exits at both ends of the blocks and have a call-point fire alarm system in communal areas which can be heard throughout the building when activated. The Granville Road flats each have two communal staircases accessed via external balconies. All flats have their own smoke alarms which sound internally. Communal doors and the front doors of all flats are standard fire doors with smoke seals and strips which swell when in contact with heat to seal the door completely. This prevents smoke and fire entering a property, or from spreading from a property for a period of time. If tenants find, between our inspections, any damage to any of these features they should report them as a matter of urgency to our Repairs Helpdesk who will arrange repairs as a priority.  </p>\n<h3>Sprinklers</h3>\n<p>Currently there are only sprinklers in the bin storage areas.</p>\n<h3>Fire risk assessments</h3>\n<p>In the light of the Grenfell Tower fire and to provide assurance to our tenants the council has carried out  Fire Risk Assessments in all blocks. These were completed in early July. Prior to this Fire Risk Assessments were last carried out as follows:           </p>\n<ul>\n<li>193 Wensley Rd  &#8211; 23/6/17</li>\n<li>203 Wensley Rd &#8211; 19/1/16</li>\n<li>205 Wensley Rd &#8211; 23/6/17</li>\n<li>28 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n<li>34 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n<li>38 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n<li>42 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A fully qualified fire risk assessor is responsible for carrying out the assessments. They are a trained officer of the council.</p>\n<p>None of the risk assessments showed the high rise buildings to be at high risk from fire.</p>\n<h3><strong>Royal Berkshire Fire Service</strong></h3>\n<p>The council owns and manages 375 blocks of flats. Since 2009, the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service has audited circa 90 per cent of the council&#8217;s blocks of flats with communal areas and have not raised any significant issues.   Since the Grenfell Tower fire the Fire Service have visited and visually inspected all of the council&#8217;s high rise blocks. Once RBFRS have visited a building they will notify the owner/landlord of any issues noted which require action. They can issue a &#8216;deficiency notice&#8217; on a building and no notices have been served on the council in recent years.</p>\n<p>The council is working closely with RBFRS and we are sharing information in regard to our building stock.  We welcome inspections from the fire brigade on our high-rise blocks or other housing stock. We will continue to liaise with our fire and rescue service colleagues for advice and support and to ensure we have as complete an understanding as possible across agencies and can provide up to date advice to tenants and residents.</p>\n<p>None of these buildings have been found to have a category 1 fire hazard under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System.</p>\n<h2>Fires in recent years</h2>\n<p>Fires have all been successfully contained in the originating area and where fires have been inside flats, none of them have spread outside the flat. Details of the fires are below:</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 1346px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"Details of the fires\" width=\"591\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>06/06/2009</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>34 Granville Road</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arson</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>01/02/2010</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lift foyer 205 Wensley Road</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arson, opportunist, trade waste</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>07/03/2011</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>203 Wensley Road</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arson Fire originating in bin store area, lighted cigarette in a ball of paper, started deliberately.

If you break the terms, we may extend the trial period or &#8211; in serious cases &#8211; evict you. If you pass this stage, you will become a secure tenant, with the extra rights they have.</p>\n<p>Introductory tenants cannot carry out any alterations or improvements to their property (except painting and decorating).</p>\n<h2>Secure tenancy</h2>\n<p>Secure tenants can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stay living in their home as long as they like</li>\n<li>ask for permission to sublet, take in lodgers or improve their home</li>\n<li>pass on their tenancy to a family member or exchange their home with another council tenant</li>\n<li>buy their home</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you break your agreement, we can demote your tenancy. You would then have similar rights to an introductory tenant.</p>\n<h2>Gas safety</h2>\n<p>We have to carry out a free annual gas safety check in your property. The check usually takes less than an hour. We will write to let you know when the check is due.

You can do this if you are an introductory or a secure tenant. Once you have assigned your tenancy you no longer have any right to occupy your home.</p>\n<p>You can assign your tenancy to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your husband, wife or partner (someone you live with as a couple)</li>\n<li>another member of your family (for example, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, including step or half relations) if they have been living with you for the last 12 months and it is their only or principle home</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You cannot assign your tenancy to friends who live with you.</p>\n<h3>Permission</h3>\n<p>If you pass on your tenancy to another person without our permission your tenancy will no longer be secure. You cannot move out and leave family/friends living in your home &#8211; if you do they will be seen as unauthorised occupants.

The term &#8216;close relative&#8217; includes grandparents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, half-relatives, step parents and people related by marriage. It is usually a private arrangement between the child&#8217;s parents (or someone with parental responsibility for the child) and the carers, and without any initial involvement from Children&#8217;s Services. Private fostering arrangements can arise for many reasons, for example, schooling, health care, family breakdown, parents&#8217; antisocial work patterns and extended holidays.</p>\n<p>Local authorities have a legal duty to safeguard the health and welfare of children living in private fostering arrangements. For us to meet our statutory responsibilities for the child, we need to know that they are being privately fostered.</p>\n<h2>The law relating to private fostering</h2>\n<p>Private foster carers do not have parental responsibility but do provide a home and day-to-day care for the child.

    "content": "<h2>The Reading SACRE</h2>\n<p>SACRE means &#8216;Standing Advisory Council [on] Religious Education&#8217;. In the 1944 Education Act, each local education authority was empowered to set up a SACRE, but not compelled to do so. However, in the 1988 Education Act the setting up of a SACRE was made compulsory.</p>\n<p>A SACRE is a part of local government and its principal function is to advise the local authority on matters related to Religious Education and Collective Worship in schools. All students in schools must receive religious education and all schools must provide a daily act of worship within a broadly Christian context.</p>\n<p>Each SACRE usually meets once each term to fulfil its statutory duties, which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>advise the local authority on matters related to the Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education</li>\n<li>advise on Collective Worship and how it can be performed</li>\n<li>publish an Annual Report to the local authority and the secretary of State for education on the activities of the SACRE</li>\n<li>the SACRE must hold meetings open to the public, so the dates, times and places should be published by the local authority</li>\n<li>minutes of each meeting must be recorded and published for public record</li>\n<li>consider appeals from schools wishing to modify the legal requirement for acts of Collective Worship being of a broadly Christian character, and to hear these appeals by means of a procedure called &#8216;Determination&#8217;. The SACRE decides the outcome of such appeals, whether to allow changes or decline the changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also &#8211;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The SACRE is responsible for providing the Agreed Local Syllabus for Religious Education, which is reviewed about once every five years. The Reading Agreed syllabus is produced in collaboration with the Pan-Berkshire SACRE Hub, originally instituted to provide the 2012-2017 R.E. Syllabus. This means that the Syllabus is agreed and shared by the six Berkshire local authorities through the work of the Hub, on which committee the six authorities are represented. The New Revised Statutory Berkshire R.E. Syllabus published in June/July 2018 for 2018-2023, is the most recent version of the Agreed syllabus.</li>\n<li>The SACRE provides CPD free of charge for the teachers of R.E. in the local authority. This is available to ALL teachers of Religious Education, in the Reading Borough through the termly Teachers&#8217; R.E. Network Meetings. Schools not under the domain of the local authority may be charged a reasonable fee for events of a special nature, e.g. an R.E. conference. The Network Meetings are free to ALL schools. <a href=\"https://discoveryschemeofwork.com/crossing-the-bridges/\">Download free teaching resources from the RE discovery scheme of work</a>.</li>\n<li>The SACRE must consider complaints made about the teaching of R.E. referred to the SACRE by the local authority</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How is the SACRE composed? It consists of four groups: A, B, C, and D, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group A:  Representatives of Christian Denominations other than the Church of England, together with representatives of other faiths reflecting the principal religions in the area</li>\n<li>Group B: Representatives of the Church of England</li>\n<li>Group C: Representatives of Teacher and Head Teacher Associations, Teachers of R.E. and others representing bodies concerned with religious education</li>\n<li>Group D: Members representing the local authority, usually elected councillors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Numbers in each group are determined by the Constitution of the SACRE. (Information is available from the local authority.) Meetings must have at least one member from each group present to be quorate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://democracy.reading.gov.uk/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=214\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE)</a></p>\n",

You should contact the school directly if you wish to appeal for any of the following schools:</p>\n<h3>Primary Schools</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All Saints Junior School</li>\n<li>Civitas Academy</li>\n<li>Green Park Village Academy</li>\n<li>Meadow Park Academy</li>\n<li>Ranikhet Academy</li>\n<li>St Anne&#8217;s Catholic Primary</li>\n<li>St Martin&#8217;s Catholic Primary</li>\n<li>St Mary &amp; All Saints CE Academy</li>\n<li>The Palmer Academy</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Secondary Schools</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>John Madejski Academy</li>\n<li>Prospect School</li>\n<li>Reading Girls&#8217; School</li>\n<li>UTC Reading</li>\n<li>The WREN School</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Appeal hearing</h2>\n<p>An Appeal Panel is made up of three people who are independent of the Local Authority and the school you are appealing for.</p>\n<p>You have the right to come to the appeal hearing and present your case, or someone can present your case on your behalf. It is important to attend if you can, but whether you attend or not, the Appeal Panel will carefully consider all the written information you submit. A representative of the school will be present at the appeal hearing. The Clerk to the Appeal Panel will also be present at the appeal hearing to give independent advice if required and to keep a record of what happens.</p>\n<p>You will be given 10 school days&#8217; notice of the date, time and location of the appeal hearing and will be sent a copy of the written information submitted by you and the school&#8217;s representative in advance of the appeal hearing.</p>\n<p>We try to make the appeal hearing as informal as possible. The school&#8217;s representative will explain the reasons why your child has not been offered a place at the school you applied for. You and the Appeal Panel will be able to ask questions on their case. You will then be given the chance to present your case in support of your appeal. The Appeal Panel will already have all the written information you have submitted. The Appeal Panel and the school&#8217;s representative can then ask you questions if they need any further information on your case. There will be a summing up stage where you and the school&#8217;s representative can put forward the main points of what you have said.</p>\n<h2>Appeal decision</h2>\n<p>You will be sent the Appeal Panel&#8217;s decision in writing, normally within five school days of the appeal hearing.</p>\n<p>Your appeal will be considered on its own merits. The decision making processes that Appeal Panels have to follow are explained in our School Admission Appeals Guide. There is a separate decision making process for appeals affected by infant class size legislation, which limits an infant class to 30 children.</p>\n<p>If your appeal is allowed, your child will be able to go to the school, and you can contact the school about taking up the place.</p>\n<p>There is no right of appeal against the Appeal Panel&#8217;s decision. If you feel the appeals procedure has not been carried out properly then you can contact the Clerk to the Appeal Panel for information on how you can complain about this.</p>\n<h2>2020-2021&nbsp;timetable of admission appeals</h2>\n<p>The appeals timetable sets out key dates of the appeals process.</p>\n<h3>For secondary school entry into Year 7 in September 2020</h3>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Admission appeal timetable - secondary schools\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 2 March 2020</td>\n<td>Secondary national offer day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 30 March 2020</td>\n<td>Deadline for submitting appeals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 1 May 2020 to Friday 16 June 2020</td>\n<td>Appeals heard</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>For primary school entry into Reception in September 2020</h3>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 114px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"Admission appeal timetable - primary school\" width=\"576\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Thursday 16 April 2020</td>\n<td>Primary national offer day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 18 May 2020</td>\n<td>Deadline for submitting appeals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 1 June 2020 to<br />\nFriday 17 July 2020</td>\n<td>Appeals heard</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Appeal timescales</h3>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"School admission appeals timetable\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Timescale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadline for submitting appeal</td>\n<td>20 school days from national offer day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Appeals submitted by the deadline</td>\n<td>Heard within 40 school days of the deadline for submitting appeals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Late appeals and appeals for in-year admission</td>\n<td>Heard within 30 school days of the appeal being submitted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parents informed of appeal date by letter</td>\n<td>At least 10 school days before appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Admission Authority to submit its information for appeal to the Clerk</td>\n<td>Approximately 2 weeks before appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circulation of paperwork for appeal to all parties by the Clerk</td>\n<td>Approximately 1 week before appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadline for parents to submit any additional information for appeal</td>\n<td>5 working days before the appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decision letter sent</td>\n<td>Within 5 school days of decision being made (may take longer during May, June and July)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Please note that appeals are not held during school holidays.</p>\n",
