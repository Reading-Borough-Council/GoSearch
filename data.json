    "content": "<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Until 1 April 2016 Discretionary Rate Relief (DRR) was dealt with through the Council’s corporate grants process, with local organisations that benefited from a core funding grant receiving DRR as part of that process.<br />\nDRR was provided on an annual basis, with the need to re-apply each year as part of the annual grants application round.</p>\n<p>In December 2015 following extensive consultation with the local voluntary<br />\nsector, a commissioning process was put in place to help with ‘Narrowing<br />\nthe Gap’ in poverty in Reading and competitive bids were received in the<br />\ncontext of significant savings on the grants budget.</p>\n<p>Funding agreements will be in place from 1 June 2016 and all groups in<br />\nreceipt of core funding grants were given due notice of the cessation of<br />\ngrant funding.</p>\n<p>From 1 April 2016, the voluntary sector annual grants process has ceased,<br />\nand there is no annual grants process for the consideration of DRR.</p>\n<h2>Changes from 1 April 2016</h2>\n<p>The authority to grant DRR is delegated to the Head of Customer Services in<br />\nconsultation with the Head of Finance.</p>\n<h3>Criteria</h3>\n<p>We will consider applications for DRR from 1 April 2016 based on the extent<br />\nto which the application meets all of the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The extent to which the organisation helps Reading Borough Council<br />\nmeet local needs, AND</li>\n<li>The extent to which the organisation matches priorities set out in<br />\nReading Borough Council’s Corporate Plan, AND</li>\n<li>That the organisation will face hardship if support is not provided<br />\nthrough DRR</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Maximum Discretionary Rate Relief Period</h3>\n<p>DRR will be granted for a maximum of 12 months. In granting DRR we will<br />\nconsider the sustainability of the organisation.</p>\n<p>DRR will only be granted if there is a risk that the organisation will become<br />\nunviable, and that the granting of DRR in the short term will make the<br />\norganisation sustainable for a reasonable period in the future.</p>\n<p>There are a number of exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early Years Providers will be considered for DRR as part of a funding formula that targets children and families in greatest need. Both privately owned and voluntary managed Early Years providers will be eligible. Please contact the Early Years and Play Services on 0118 937 37 37</li>\n<li>Voluntary, not for profit and private sector providers that are currently commissioned to provide services on behalf of Reading Borough Council will not generally be considered for DRR as they should already have demonstrated that they are financially viable at the start of the arrangement. These organisations would have to demonstrate that their circumstances have substantially changed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HOW TO APPLY<br />\nApplication forms are available and should be returned by 15th June<br />\n2016 for DRR between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applicants will be informed of the outcome by 13th July 2016 and<br />\nif successful DRR will be backdated to 1 April 2016.</li>\n<li>Applicants should continue to pay rates until a decision is made. Any<br />\noverpayment will be refunded to you as part of the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your circumstances change mid-year, please contact Business Rates and<br />\nask for an application form and deadlines. We will look at mid-year<br />\napplications in October and January each year. You should continue to pay<br />\nrates until a decision is made and we will take into account the need to<br />\nbackdate DRR as part of our decision.</p>\n<p>An application form for DRR for charitable/ not for profit organisations is<br />\navailable to download.

    "content": "<ol>\n<li>INTRODUCTION</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.1 Reading is the County Town of Berkshire. It is currently the third most diverse and one of the most cosmopolitan and dynamic communities in the South East. It lies at the heart of the Thames Valley, and is widely regarded as the &#8216;Silicon Valley&#8217; of the UK. Over the last 10 years, Reading has also benefited from being one of the fastest growing and sustained economies in the country. Whilst the recent economic downturn had an impact, the effect was to a lesser degree than in some areas of the country. It is still home to 13 of the world&#8217;s top 30 global brands, with the likes of Prudential, Microsoft and Oracle all based locally.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.2 Whilst the borough of Reading covers some 4030 hectares and is also home to around 145,000 residents, the wider urban area has a population of around 275,000 with an even broader retail &#8216;catchment area&#8217; of over 1.2 This is a significant aspect of the Reading of today: a sub-regional capital attracting large numbers of workers, shoppers and visitors from a wide area, adding to its vitality and success. Over 13% of the population is made up from minority ethnic communities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.3 Reading has a University, which during term time, further increase the residential population by around 17,500 and a College of Further Education which increases the population during term time by a further 8,500, many of whom again contribute to Reading&#8217;s economy.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.4 The ongoing regeneration of the town centre and the arrival of The Oracle shopping centre, originally lifted Reading into the top ten retail destinations in the UK, and it has maintained this position until very recently. However, it is currently rated at 16 on most recent research.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.5 One of the reasons that town centres like Reading are attractive to the public, is that they are areas offering an attractive, safe and vehicle-free environment with a wide variety of retail, food leisure and services on offer. The public are drawn to such areas because they know that they will have a pleasant and satisfying social experience that goes beyond just commercial activity. This is borne out by the quality and quantity of the businesses that pay significant amounts of non-domestic rates and a Business Improvement District levy to maintain and where possible improve that standard.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.6 The Oracle is a large privately owned shopping complex to the south of the area. Because it is private, the quality of the pedestrian and leisure experience can be said to be the most appealing in the town centre. When it originally opened, there were a number of large nightclub venues. However, recent years has seen a shift in the type of venue available, with a greater influence towards family entertainment, restaurants and specialised markets.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.7 Whilst Reading is the largest and the County town in Berkshire, there are many other towns of substantial size, including from the east to west, Slough, Windsor, Maidenhead, Bracknell, Wokingham and Newbury, many residents of which regularly visit Reading for retail and social activities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.8 Reading&#8217;s vision for the shaping of its future has been carefully considered by seeking views from its residents, local businesses and all its partners, in order to ensure a thriving and balanced environment with a sustainable economy. Social premises should be varied so as to provide diversity and choice. They should be attractive and accessible to all.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1.9 The intention of the local authority is to create a well-balanced mix of alcohol and entertainment venues, thereby catering for the widest possible cultural and ethnic diversity.</p>\n<p>2. THE PRESENT</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.1 The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1982 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;) introduced a licensing scheme to control sex establishments, that is to say, sex shops and sex cinemas.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.2 Section 27 of the Policing and crime Act 2009 amends Schedule 3 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) 1982. It introduces the new concept of &#8220;Sexual Entertainment Venue&#8221; and allows the Licensing Authority to licence such venues, where &#8220;relevant entertainment&#8221; is provided;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(a) before a live audience; and</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(b) for the financial gain of the organiser or the entertainer.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.3 Relevant entertainment means, &#8220;any live performance or any live display of nudity&#8221;, provided solely or principally for the purpose of stimulating any member of the audience.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.4 Reading Borough Council has adopted the Act, and at present, there are two sex shops in the borough. One is located on Southampton Street, and one is located on Oxford Road. At present there are no licensed Sexual Entertainment Venues; however there is one premise that operates as a lap dancing club, which is located in the town centre on St Mary Butts. This premise will require a Sex Establishment Licence under the change made to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 in 2010.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.5 A number of establishments that hold events, which involve full or partial nudity less frequently than once a month, may not require a Sex Establishment licence or may be except from the requirements to obtain a Sex Establishment Applicants are advised to contact the local authority for details.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.6 The Act imposes a duty on a local authority to refuse a licence by reference to, amongst other things, the criminal convictions of applicants. It also empowers a local authority to refuse to grant or renew a licence by reference to the number of Sex Establishments, which the local authority considers appropriate for the locality of the premises, subject of the application and the character of the locality.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.7 This document outlines a policy, which will guide the Council when considering applications for licences, bearing in mind the spirit and intent of the Act and case law decided since it was passed. The Council shall not follow this policy inflexibly but shall take all relevant factors into consideration in determining an application. Each case shall be decided on its merits.</p>\n<p>3. APPLICANTS</p>\n<p>Individuals, limited companies and firms may apply for licences.</p>\n<p>4. DURATION OF LICENCES</p>\n<p>Licences are generally issued on an annual basis but can be issued for a shorter term if deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p>5. CRIME AND DISORDER</p>\n<p>Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, local authorities must have regard to the likely effect of the exercise of their functions, and do all that they can to prevent, crime and disorder in their area. This policy will have regard to the likely impact of such licences on related crime and disorder in the borough.</p>\n<p>6. HUMAN RIGHTS</p>\n<p>The Human Rights Act 1998, incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights, and makes it unlawful for a local authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. The Council will have particular regard to the following relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights: &#8211;</p>\n<p>(i) Article 6, in relation to the determination of civil rights and obligations, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time, by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law;</p>\n<p>(ii) Article 8, in that everyone has the right to respect for his home and private life, including, for example, the right to a &#8220;good night sleep&#8221;;</p>\n<p>(iii) Article 1 of the first protocol, that every person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his or her possessions. It should be noted that the Courts have held that a licence is a person&#8217;s possession.</p>\n<p>7. DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">7.1 The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, introduced measures to tackle discrimination encountered by disabled people in the areas of employment, access to goods, facilities and services and the management, buying or renting of land or property. For service providers, such as licensees: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) with effect from December 1996, it has been unlawful to treat disabled people less favourably than other people for a reason related to their disability;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(ii) with effect from October 1999, they have had to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, such as providing extra help to make changes to the way they provide their services;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(iii) with effect from 2004, they have had to make reasonable adjustments to the physical features of the premises to overcome physical barriers to access.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">7.2 This policy will have regard to the likely impact of licensing of sex establishment on disability discrimination particularly when considering the operation and management of the premises.</p>\n<p>8. IMPACT</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">8.1 In considering applications for the grant of new licences or variation of conditions, the Council will assess the likelihood of a grant causing adverse impacts, particularly on local residents. The Council will take the following general matters into account: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) type of activity;<br />(ii) duration of proposed licence;<br />(iii) proposed hours of operation;<br />(iv) layout and condition of the premises;<br />(v) the use to which premises in the vicinity are put;<br />(vi) the character of the locality in which the premises are situated.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">8.2 In considering all applications for the grant of new licences or applications for variation of conditions the Council will take into account the potential impacts of the licensed activity on:-</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) crime and disorder;<br />(ii) cumulative impact of licensed premises in the area, including hours of operation;<br />(iii) the character of the locality in which the premises is situated;<br />(iv) public Safety;<br />(v) prevention of Public Nuisance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">8.3 Where an application is made to renew a licence for the same activity, hours of operation and conditions as previously licensed the Council shall give due weight to the fact that the licence was granted in the previous year and for a number of years before that as appropriate. However, the Council will take into account: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) levels of recorded crime and disorder in area;<br />(ii) evidence of past demonstrable adverse impacts from the activity on the safety and amenity of local residents;<br />(iii) whether appropriate measures have been agreed and put into effect by the applicant to mitigate any adverse impacts.</p>\n<p>9. LOCATION</p>\n<p>9.1 Licences will only be granted in predominately commercial areas and the Council is mindful of its power to determine that no sex establishment should be located in a particular locality. In accordance with case law, the Council shall decide a locality as a matter of fact to be determined by the particular circumstances of each case and not by drawing boundaries on a map. The table below is not exhaustive and we would consider representations from applicants as to why our view should be changed about a particular locality.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><th>Locality</th><th>Number of sex entertainment venues</th><th>Reason</th></tr><tr><td>Reading town centre (appendix I)</td><td>Two</td><td>Varied night time economy, entertainment area, SEV, would be appropriate in this area.</td></tr><tr><td>Caversham (North of the Thames)</td><td>None</td><td>The whole area is mainly residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Portman Road Industrial Estate</td><td>One</td><td>Very limited residential properties mainly small industrial units</td></tr><tr><td>Wensley Road,<br>Southcote Road</td><td>None</td><td>These areas are residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Whitley Wood residential areas</td><td>None</td><td>The whole are is residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Craddock Road and Acre Road Industrial areas</td><td>One</td><td>Very limited residential properties mainly mixed industrial</td></tr><tr><td>South East Reading (eg Orts Road, Kendrick Road and Palmer Park area)</td><td>None</td><td>The whole are is residential, with limited commercial or retail areas</td></tr><tr><td>Tilehurse area (eg Tilehurst Road, Oxford Road, Norcot Road, School Road)</td><td>None</td><td> The whole are is residential, with limited commercial or retail areas </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n<p>10. FITNESS OF APPLICANT POLICIES</p>\n<p>An applicant must be a fit and proper person to hold a licence. In determining suitability for a new licence or a transfer the Council will in most case take into account:-</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(i) previous knowledge and experience of the applicant;<br />(ii) any evidence of the operation of any existing or previous licence held by the applicant, including any licence held in any other borough;<br />(iii) and any report about the applicant and management of the premises received from statutory objectors.</p>\n<p>11. SUITABILITY POLICY</p>\n<p>All licensees are required to ensure that the premises: &#8211;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(i) comply with all health and safety law;<br />(ii) are not a source of nuisance to residents in the vicinity.</p>\n<p>12. PROPOSED OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT POLICIES</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.1 The Council requires all licensees to ensure that they and their employees comply with all relevant licence conditions and health and safety regulations.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.2 In terms of management of licensed premises, the Council strongly encourages where possible and appropriate, will require that licensees:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(i) work with statutory agencies such as the Police, and the Council in order to create and maintain a safe environment; both within licensed premises and in the environs around them;<br />(ii) particularly those whose premises are located in areas with the highest levels of recorded crime, develop crime prevention strategies in consultation with the Police and the council.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.3 In terms of the management of licensed premises, the Council strongly encourages and where possible and appropriate will require all licensees to develop strategies and procedures to increase access for disabled people to the premises.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">12.4 In terms of the employment of staff in licensed premises, the Council requires that all relevant staff be appropriately trained in areas such as health and safety, first aid, and fire precautions.</p>\n<p>13. PUBLIC CONSULTATION</p>\n<p>The Council will normally consult local residents in relations to applications for grant, renewal or variation of the terms or conditions of a licence. The nature and extent of consultation will depend on the history of a particular premises and the perceived likelihood of problems occurring and objections being received.</p>\n<p>14. LEGAL CONSULTATIONS</p>\n<p>Applicants are required to give public notice of the application by publishing an advertisement in a local newspaper circulating in the area where the premises are situated and to display a similar notice on or near the premises for 21 days beginning with the date of the application.</p>\n<p>15. CONSULTATION WITH STATUTORY AGENCIES AND OTHER ORGANISATION</p>\n<p>In most cases the Council will consult with all relevant services within the Council and the Fire Authority to ensure that all relevant information is available when considering an application.</p>\n<p>(Planning see item 1)</p>\n<p>16. CONSULTATION WITH WARD COUNCILLORS</p>\n<p>Relevant Ward Councillors will be notified in writing of all applications for grant, renewals and transfer of licences and the variation of conditions within their Ward, and also those on or near the Ward boundary.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">16.1 In considering any application for the grant, renewal or transfer of a licence the Council is also obliged to have regard to any observations submitted by the Chief Constable of police and any objections received from members of the public in response to public advertisement of the application.</p>\n<p>17. OTHER POLICIES</p>\n<p>The Council may identify and apply other requirements from time to time, subject to consultation and proper notice.</p>\n<p>18. PLANNING</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.1 The Authority recognises that licensing applications should not be seen as a re-run of the planning application process and that there should be a clear separation of the planning and licensing regimes to avoid duplication and inefficiency. However, the Authority will normally expect applicants to demonstrate that, their proposed use of the premises is lawful in planning  terms,  including  complying with any conditions that may be imposed upon a planning consent, prior to applications under this Act being submitted. Nevertheless, the Council recognises that it is legally permissible for applications for licences to be made before any relevant planning permission has been sought or granted by the planning authority.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.2 As outlined at paragraph 13.67 of the Consolidated Guidance issued under Section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003 (March 2010 version), there are also circumstances when as a condition of planning permission; a terminal hour has been set for the use of premises for commercial purposes. Where these hours are different to the licensing hours, the applicant MUST observe the earlier closing time. Premises operating in breach of their planning permission would be liable to prosecution under planning law.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.3 Where a licence application is to be determined by the Licensing Applications Sub Committee, the Sub Committee in such cases will normally impose a condition to the effect that the licence will not become effective, until the relevant planning consent has been obtained.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.4 Reading Borough Council is preparing its Local Development Framework. To date, it has adopted two documents and is working on a further document. The planning policy framework also currently relies on a number of saved policies from the Reading Borough Local Plan that was adopted in 1998.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.5 The Local Development Framework consists of a number of documents, which are reviewed and modified to take account of ever changing demands. Currently these are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(a) Core Strategy (adopted Jan 2008) &#8211; sets out the spatial vision and strategic objectives, a spatial strategy and core policies related to the implementation of the strategy. </p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(b) Reading Central Area Action Plan (Adopted Jan 2009) &#8211; policies and proposals for the central area of Reading.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">(c) Sites and Detailed Policies Document &#8211; a pre-submission draft was published for consultation during February 2010. It is likely that further consultation will be undertaken early in 2011 and the programme envisages adoption of the document towards the end of 2011/early 2012. This document includes specific site allocations for the Borough outside the Central Area and detailed policies to be used for determining planning applications.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.6 Until the Sites and Detailed Policies Document is adopted, various policies in the Reading Borough Local Plan have been saved and will remain part of the development plan. (See web link below). These include the following policies that are relevant to licensed premises:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RET 3A: District and Major Local Shopping Centres (LP)</li>\n<li>RET 3B: Other Local Shopping Centres (LP)</li>\n<li>RET 5: Retail and Catering Users in Residential Areas (LP)</li>\n<li>RET 7: Petrol Filling Stations and Other Vehicle Related Uses (LP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.7 These main Local Development Documents (LDD&#8217;s) are used in conjunction with national planning policy statements. Also, at the local level, there are a number of site-specific developments, briefs and supplementary planning and guidance documents, which are relevant to various parts of the borough.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">18.8 The LDD&#8217;s will seek to strengthen existing district and local centres. Whilst no definitive extensions to these centres have been agreed from a planning perspective, licensed premises in these areas will play an important role as part of this objective and within the role of the 24-hour economy in Planning permission for A3 (or similar) uses are therefore likely to be restricted within these areas rather than within other predominantly residential areas.</p>\n<p>18.9 The Reading Central Area Action Plan identifies in more detail issues relating to licensed premises, the 24-hour economy and the general organisation of retailing within the town</p>\n<p>18.10 The key issues surrounding the determination of planning permission for A3 type uses are likely to remain as follows:</p>\n<p>(a) Impact on residential amenity through noise, odour, disturbance, litter, etc.<br />(b) Impact on the viability of the Town Centre, defined district and local centres including the need to maintain reasonable levels of retail (A1) uses.<br />(c) Potential S106 contributions towards CCTV and City Safe<br />(d) Each planning application will continue to be considered on its own merits.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The Council consulted widely with residents, memorial owners, families of the bereaved and other stakeholders about amending the Rules and Regulations that apply to Reading Cemeteries and Crematorium. Revisions were made to support the implementation of the Charter for the Bereaved by offering more choice, whilst giving the Service the regulatory framework necessary to ensure a safe and dignified environment for all visitors, which is sympathetic to the landscape.</p>\n<p>The amended Rules and Regulations were approved by council’s Cabinet on 11 July 2011. This Enforcement Framework was approved at the same time to form part of the Rules and Regulations as an Appendix.

    "content": "<h2>The Art of a Good Marriage</h2>\n<p>A Good marriage must be created.<br />\nIn marriage the little things are the big things&#8230;.<br />\nIt is never being too old to hold hands.,<br />\nIt is remembering to say &#8220;I love you&#8221; at least once a day.<br />\nIt is never going to sleep angry.<br />\nIt is having a mutual sense of values and common objectives.<br />\nIt is standing together and facing the world.<br />\nIt is forming a circle of love that gathers in the whole family.<br />\nIt is speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating gratitude in thoughtful ways.<br />\nIt is having the capacity to forgive and forget.<br />\nIt is giving each other an atmosphere in which each can grow.<br />\nIt is a common search for the good and the beautiful.<br />\nIt is not only marrying the right person, it is being the right partner.</p>\n<h2>The Most Wonderful Of All Things In Life</h2>\n<p>The most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom one&#8217;s relationship has a growing depth, beauty and joy as the years increase. This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvellous thing; it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it. It is a sort of divine accident, and the most wonderful of all things in life.</p>\n<h2>What is Love</h2>\n<p>Sooner or later we begin to understand that love is more than verse on valentines and romance in the movies. We begin to know that love is here and now, real and true, the most important thing in our lives. For love is the creator of our favourite memories and the foundation of our fondest dreams. Love is a<br />\npromise that is always kept, a fortune that can never be spent, a seed that can flourish in even the most unlikely of places. And this radiance that never fades,<br />\nthis mysterious and magical joy, is the greatest treasure of all &#8211; one known only by those who love.</p>\n<h2>Marriage is a Commitment to Life</h2>\n<p>Marriage is a commitment to life, the best that two people can find and bring out in each other. It offers opportunities for sharing and growth that no other<br />\nrelationship can equal. It is a physical and an emotional joining that is promised for a lifetime. Within the circle of its love, marriage encompasses all of life&#8217;s most important relationships. A wife and a husband are each other&#8217;s best friend, confidant, lover, teacher, listener and critic. And there may come times when one partner is heartbroken or ailing and the love of the other may resemble the tender caring of a parent for a child.</p>\n<p>Marriage deepens and enriches every facet of life. Happiness is fuller, memories are fresher, commitment is stronger, even anger is felt more strongly, and passes away more quickly. Marriage understands and forgives the mistakes life is unable to avoid. It encourages and nurtures new life, new experiences and new ways of expressing a love that is deeper than life.</p>\n<p>When two people pledge their love and care for each other in marriage they create a spirit unique unto themselves which binds them closer than any spoken<br />\nor written words. Marriage is a promise, a potential made in the hearts of two people who love each other and takes a lifetime to fulfil.</p>\n<h2>Captain Corelli&#8217;s Mandolin</h2>\n<p>Love is a temporary madness; it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides.<br />\nAnd when it subsides, you have to make a decision.<br />\nYou have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is.</p>\n<p>Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of<br />\nthe day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don&#8217;t blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being &#8220;in love&#8221;, which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.</p>\n<h2>Guide for a Loving Home</h2>\n<p>May we treat one another with respect, honesty and care. May we share the little discoveries and changes each day brings. May we try always to be sensitive to one another&#8217;s joys, sorrows, needs and changing moods, and realise that being a loving family means sometimes not understanding everyone all the time, but being there to love and help them just the same.</p>\n<h2>From Mark Twain</h2>\n<p>A marriage&#8230;&#8230; Makes of two fractional lives a whole; it gives two purposeless lives a work, and doubles the strength of each to perform it; it gives to two<br />\nquestioning natures a reason for living, and something to live for; it will give a new gladness to the sunshine, a new fragrance to the flowers, a new beauty to the earth, and a new mystery to life.</p>\n<h2>Marriage</h2>\n<p>Marriage is a dynamic process of discovery.<br />\nMarriage is a journey not an arrival.<br />\nIn marriage, being the right person is as important as finding the right person.<br />\nMarriage is starting to love, over and over again.<br />\nMarriage is a life&#8217;s work.<br />\nMarriage is an art&#8230; and like any creative process, it requires active thought and effort.<br />\nIn marriage there is a need to learn how to share on many different levels.<br />\nIn marriage there is a need to practise talking from the heart, and understanding attitudes as well as words.<br />\nGiving generously and receiving graciously are talents that are available to anyone.<br />\nBut all these skills need to be developed, if the marriage picture that we paint is to be anything approaching the masterpiece intended.</p>\n<h2>Extract from &#8216;Portrait of a Marriage&#8217; (Nigel Nicolson)</h2>\n<p>Marriage was they thought, only tolerable for people of strong character and independent minds if it were regarded as a lifetime association between intimate friends. And as a happy marriage is &#8216;the greatest of human benefits&#8217;, husband and wife must strive hard for its success. Each must be subtle enough to mould their characters and behaviour to fit the other&#8217;s, facet to facet, convex to concave. The husband must develop the feminine side of his nature, the wife her<br />\nmasculine side. He must cultivate the qualities of sympathy and intuition; she those of detachment, reason and decision. He must respond to tears; she must not miss trains&#8230;.</p>\n<h2>From Sir Philip Sidney</h2>\n<p>My true love hath my heart, and I have his,<br />\nBy just exchange one for another given.<br />\nI hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss:<br />\nThere never was a better bargain driven.<br />\nMy true love hath my heart and I have his.<br />\nHis heart in me, keeps him and me in one,<br />\nMy heart in him, his thoughts and senses guides:<br />\nHe loves my heart, for once it was his own:<br />\nI cherish his, because in me it bides.<br />\nMy true love hath my heart and I have his.</p>\n<h2>Three Short Readings (Unknown Writers)</h2>\n<p>1. Throughout your marriage always remember that the spectrum of love has nine ingredients: Patience, Kindness, Generosity, Humility, Courtesy, Unselfishness, Good Temper, Guilelessness and Sincerity. Thus will your love today survive throughout your married life.</p>\n<p>2. On your wedding day and every day thereafter May your home be filled with happiness and your hearts with love and laughter And may each year together find you more and more in love and bring you all the happiness you&#8217;re so deserving of. May the joy of true companionship be yours to share through life,<br />\nand may you treasure always the day you became husband and wife.</p>\n<p>3. Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be a shelter for the other. Now you will feel no cold, for each of you will be warmth to the other. Now there is<br />\nno more loneliness. Now you are two persons, but there is only one life before you. Go now to your dwelling to enter into the days of your life together. And may your days be good and long upon the earth.</p>\n<h2>How to Stay Together One More Day!</h2>\n<p>Laugh at yourself and at each other. Practice unselfishness. Show your love. Talk to not at, each other. Respond lovingly to his or her request. Greet and leave each other with kind words. Criticise the action, not the person. Hold hands. Resolve the day&#8217;s differences before bedtime. Admit your failings and ask for forgiveness. Don&#8217;t fight dirty. Enjoy the present and welcome the future. Make love, not waves.</p>\n<h2>From Deanne Laura Gilbert</h2>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means that I accept you for the person that you are, and that I don&#8217;t wish to change you into someone else. It means that I do not expect perfection from you, just as you don&#8217;t expect it from me.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means that I will love you and stand by you even through the worst of times. It means loving you when you are in a bad mood or too tired to do the things I want to do. It means loving you when you are down, not just when you&#8217;re fun to be with.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means that I know your deepest secrets and do not judge you for them, asking in return only that you do not judge me for mine. It means that I<br />\ncare enough not to let you go. It means thinking of you, dreaming of you, wanting and needing you constantly, and hoping you feel the same way for me.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I Love You&#8217; means forever.</p>\n<h2>Love as we know It</h2>\n<p>Love, it can be said, has many guises.<br />\nIt will shine in a Mother&#8217;s smile,<br />\nAnd be hidden in a Father&#8217;s warm embrace &#8211;<br />\nOr felt in a child&#8217;s velvet kisses.<br />\nLove may even hide in sibling squabbles.<br />\nLove is presented by Lovers in little unexpected gifts.<br />\nIt is pronounced to the world by hand-holding elderly couples.<br />\nAnd found in listening to a friend&#8217;s tears in the wee small hours.<br />\nLove is enduring and unjudging.<br />\nIt is safety and sanctuary from a world of vexation.<br />\nLove, when nurtured, grows and blossoms like honeysuckle &#8211;<br />\nSpreading and encompassing all within its reach.<br />\nLove has an incalculable value, far beyond worldly currency,<br />\nFor it cannot be bought or sold.<br />\nThat Love, which isn&#8217;t given freely, is not Love at all.<br />\nLove joins together, but does not create constraints or shackle &#8211;<br />\nRather it is a safe mooring, from which each may journey and return,<br />\nAssured of a warm homecoming.<br />\nNow may each of you be more acutely aware<br />\nOf that Love which your heart gives and receives<br />\nFor such treasure should be highly prized.</p>\n<h2>The Mathematics of Love</h2>\n<p>From today may your joys be added,<br />\nYour cares subtracted,<br />\nYour worries divided<br />\nAnd your love multiplied!<br />\nThere is no greater happiness than that of sharing life,<br />\nSharing all its joys and cares as a loving man and wife.<br />\nAnd since you&#8217;ve found that happiness, what more is there to say,<br />\nExcept to hope your joys will grow still sweeter day by day.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms (Sophie Hannah)</h2>\n<p>Although you have given me a stomach upset,<br />\nWeak knees, a lurching heart, a fuzzy brain,<br />\nA high-pitched laugh, a monumental phone bill,<br />\nA feeling of unworthiness, sharp pain<br />\nWhen you are somewhere else, a guilty conscience,<br />\nA longing, and a dread of what&#8217;s in store,<br />\nA pulse rate for the &#8216;Guinness Book of Records&#8217; &#8211;<br />\nLife is now better that it was before.</p>\n<p>Although you have given me a raging temper,<br />\nInsomnia, a rising sense of panic,<br />\nA hopeless challenge, bouts of introspection,<br />\nRaw, bitten nails, a voice that&#8217;s strangely manic,<br />\nA selfish streak, a fear of isolation,<br />\nA silly smile, lips that are chapped and sore,<br />\nA running joke, a risk, an inspiration &#8211;<br />\nLife is now better that it was before.</p>\n<p>Although you have given me premonition,<br />\nChattering teeth, a goal, a lot to lose,<br />\nA granted wish, mixed motives, superstitions,<br />\nHang-ups and headaches, fear of awful news,<br />\nA bubble in my throat, a dare to swallow,<br />\nA crack of light under a closing door,<br />\nThe crude, fantastic prospect of forever &#8211;<br />\nLife is now better than it was before.</p>\n<h2>Marriage</h2>\n<p>A Marriage is a promise that two hearts gladly make.<br />\nA promise to be tender, to help, to give and take.<br />\nA marriage is a promise to be kind and understanding.<br />\nTo be thoughtful and considerate, fair and undemanding.<br />\nA marriage is a promise to share one life together&#8230;.<br />\nA love filled promise meant to be kept lovingly forever.</p>\n<h2>When You Met</h2>\n<p>When you met you were not planning to fall in love; you were not planning to feel so attracted to someone. But when you met you awakened feelings inside yourselves that you had forgotten existed.</p>\n<p>On the day you met, you did not realise how much your love would grow; that the attraction which first brought you together would reach beyond passion, to the comfort of knowing that you each had someone very special. Someone who would be not only a lover, but also a close friend.</p>\n<p>When you met you had no idea where your relationship would lead you, or how beautiful you would make each other&#8217;s world; but today you know that without a doubt the luckiest day of your lives was the day that you met.</p>\n<h2>A Love Poem (Dorothy Court)</h2>\n<p>Love. What is it?<br />\nYou cannot hold it, neither see it.<br />\nBut it is all around us.<br />\nIt is the essence of our lives.<br />\nSooner or later you are bound to meet it.<br />\nSome people go out to greet it.<br />\nIt is there; it is here;<br />\nit is gone; it is near.<br />\nIt is something we cannot afford to miss.<br />\nThis once in a while, this bliss.<br />\nThis thing called love.</p>\n<h2>Marriage is</h2>\n<p>Learning to give not always to take,<br />\nLearning to forgive each little mistake,<br />\nLearning to love whatever the cost,<br />\nAlways remember alone you&#8217;d be lost.<br />\nTrying so hard your partner to please,<br />\nTrying to save whilst paying the fees,<br />\nTrying to smile when things turn out wrong,<br />\nAlways remember to curb your tongue.<br />\nNever think of only yourself,<br />\nNever to say you wish you had wealth.<br />\nNever let you temper get hot,<br />\nAlways be thankful for what you have got.<br />\nIf you remember all of these things,<br />\nYou will discover the joys that it brings,<br />\nThen you&#8217;ll have what so many folk miss,<br />\nAlways you&#8217;ll have a marriage of bliss.</p>\n<h2>I love you because</h2>\n<p>I love you because you&#8217;re my future,<br />\nMy present and part of my past<br />\nMy world has been turning so quickly<br />\nAnd time just keeps moving so fast.<br />\nI love you because you have something<br />\nno ordinary person can give<br />\nA warmth that I&#8217;ll cling to forever &#8211;<br />\nHold on to so long as I live<br />\nI love you because your devotion<br />\nIs tender and wonderfully rare<br />\nCould anyone ever imagine?<br />\nThe magic moments we share?<br />\nI love you because you are truthful,<br />\nYour eyes hold the key to my heart<br />\nTell me you share my commitment,<br />\nAnd say we shall not be apart.<br />\nI love you because you are wonderful,<br />\nYou give me all that I need<br />\nA hug when I seek reassurance,<br />\nA smile if we have disagreed.<br />\nI love you because&#8230;..

This relates to the following types of appointments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>notice of marriage</li>\n<li>civil partnership notice</li>\n<li>marriage ceremonies</li>\n<li>re-registration of birth</li>\n<li>civil partnership conversion ceremonies</li>\n<li>individual citizenship ceremonies</li>\n<li>renewal of vows</li>\n<li>naming ceremonies</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Booking deposit fees (ceremonies)</h2>\n<p>A non-refundable and non-transferable booking deposit is payable at the time of booking.</p>\n<p>The remaining balance is payable at the time of giving notice of marriage or no later than a week after giving notice should the notice be given at another Register Office.</p>\n<h2>Notice of marriage/civil partnership</h2>\n<p>It is your responsibility to bring the correct documents to the appointment. If your notice of marriage/civil partnership cannot be completed due to lack of documents, you may be charged an administration fee to book a new appointment.</p>\n<p>A foreign divorce is one which took place outside of the United Kingdom. If you have been divorced in a foreign country, it is your responsibility to bring the documents which confirm the the divorce can be recognised in England and Wales. A certified translation must be supplied if the documents are not in English. If the documents do not confirm your divorce  (for example, the documents are incomplete or the legal processes have not been finished in the country of divorce), the Foreign Divorce Checking Fee will not be refunded.</p>\n<h2>Cancellation of ceremony bookings by the registration service</h2>\n<p>Your ceremony may be cancelled by the Reading Registration Service if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the total fees have not been paid</li>\n<li>legal preliminaries have not or cannot be completed</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cancellation of bookings by the customer</h2>\n<p>In the event that you need to cancel a ceremony you will be required to notify us in writing.</p>\n<p>If you have already paid the balance in full:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than eight weeks before the ceremony date, you will receive a full refund of the ceremony fee (excluding the non-refundable booking fee).</li>\n<li>Between four and eight weeks before the ceremony date, you will receive 50% refund of the ceremony fee (excluding the non-refundable booking fee).</li>\n<li>Less than four weeks before the ceremony date or failure to cancel, there will be no refund.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Birth, death and marriage certificates</h2>\n<p>When registering an event (for birth, death, marriage and civil partnership), it is your responsibility to make sure all information is correct, including spelling and dates, before signing the register or schedule as this is a legal document. You will be required to pay a fee for any corrections, most of which will require the approval of the Registrar General.</p>\n<h3>Replacement Certificates</h3>\n<p>You should make sure that you have given enough information for us to verify that we have found the correct certificate. We will not be held responsible if we supply the wrong certificate because the information supplied is incorrect, incomplete or we do not have enough information to identify the correct entry.</p>\n<p>If you were married in a church or place of worship in the Borough of Reading, you must contact them first to see if they are holding the register.</p>\n<p>We are not able to help with adoption or still birth certificates. Please contact the General Register Office for these types of certificates.</p>\n<p>If you have requested multiple certificates and we cannot supply them all, you will get a partial refund for the certificates you do not get.</p>\n<h3>Refunds</h3>\n<p>If you have asked us to make a search on your behalf and the search is unsuccessful we will refund the certificate fee, but not the processing fee.</p>\n<p>If you have requested multiple certificates and we cannot supply them all, you will get a partial refund for the certificates you do not get.</p>\n<h3>Cancelling an order</h3>\n<p>You cannot cancel or amend an order once it has been place. Please ensure you have input the correct details before submitting your request.</p>\n",

    "title": "Vehicle crossing policy",
    "content": "<ol>\n<li>The vehicle hard-standing area on property frontage should have minimum dimensions of at least 2.4m wide (along the boundary entry point) and a minimum 4.8m length (this is the minimum depth of property frontage required). Note: This is a minimum requirement; a greater size may be required to accommodate larger vehicles. A greater distance /depth may also be required to allow for property access/doorways etc. The vehicle hard-standing should be constructed before, or at the same time as the vehicle crossing is constructed. It is not permitted for vehicles to overhang the public highway as this can constitute an obstruction of the public highway under the Highways Act 1980.</li>\n<li>Some roads are classified as traffic sensitive and may not be suitable for a vehicle crossing. If your property is on a classified road, the new access will require planning permission before any work can be carried out and Development Control and/or Planning will be consulted as appropriate.</li>\n<li>If the proposed vehicle crossing is in a road where there is a formalised onstreet parking scheme and/or Traffic Regulation Order in place, Network Management will be consulted as appropriate.</li>\n<li>The entrance width/opening to the property frontage should be suitable for vehicle(s) to be able to park on hard-standing(s) perpendicular on property frontage (as explained in point 1 above). Entrance width/opening needs to be wide enough so that vehicles do not ‘bump up’ full height kerbs.</li>\n<li>A vehicle crossing should be a minimum distance of 10m away from a<br />\njunction.</li>\n<li>Visibility splays/sight lines should be acceptable to ensure safe<br />\naccess/egress from property.</li>\n<li>If any tree and/or root system would be affected by the proposed vehicle crossing, Planning and Parks will be consulted as appropriate.</li>\n<li>The total continual length of dropped kerb (including where shared with neighbouring property, ideally should not exceed 10m. Note: in situations where it would be greater than 10m, the decision on whether or not to approve will be at the Council’s discretion.</li>\n<li>In situations where a neighbouring property already has an established historical/legal vehicle crossing and there is insufficient space/gap between the crossings to install ‘transition kerbs’ and ‘full-height kerbing infill’, it may be necessary to extend the existing dropped kerb from the neighbouring property to create the new vehicle crossing (‘transition kerbs’ laid back to back are not normally accepted). This will depend on the location of the proposed vehicle crossing in relation to the neighbouring existing vehicle crossing. Effectively such a situation creates a shared vehicle crossing rather than two separately defined vehicle crossings. This will be at the Council’s discretion.</li>\n<li>Water run-off from private property onto the public highway is not<br />\npermitted. An appropriate method of drainage needs to be provided within the property curtilage including the use of suitable permeable surfacing materials.</li>\n<li>Planning permission is required for any hard standing (new or<br />\nrepair/replacement) at a property that is constructed of a non-porous<br />\nmaterial (tarmac, concrete or brick paving) in excess of 5 square metres and does not have surface water run off to a permeable or porous area within the boundaries of the property, e.g. lawn. Hard standing at other properties (including flats) is likely to require planning permission regardless of the proposed material (except some industrial/warehouse uses). It is recommended that you contact Planning on (0118) 937 3787 if you require further information. If you do not meet these requirements, planning permission will be required before any work can be carried out. (A copy of the planning permission will be required).</li>\n<li>If gravel is to be used as a permeable surfacing material to the hardstanding, a non–gravel apron/strip is required across the entrance<br />\nwidth/opening on the private property frontage to prevent the gravel from migrating onto the public highway.</li>\n<li>Vehicle crossing applications will not be approved in locations where there would be a substantial loss of public highway/Council maintained grass verge and/or have a detrimental effect on the local environment/street scene.</li>\n<li>The loss of an area of grass verge up to 8m2 is acceptable, however, if an area of between 8m2 and 15m2 of public highway /Council maintained grass verge is considered for removal, it will need to be replaced by a suitable permeable bituminous/tarmacadam material appropriate for use on the public highway and approved by the Council. This material will be applied to all of the crossing area to reduce the impact of surfacing a verge area.</li>\n<li>Street furniture (e.g. sign posts, street lighting columns) should be a<br />\nminimum distance of 1.0m from a vehicle crossing (top of transition kerb) to reduce risk of damage from turning vehicles. Note: where it is considered feasible/agreed by the Council to relocate/reposition street<br />\nfurniture/utility equipment so as not to impede a vehicle crossing, all costs associated with such work to be charged to vehicle crossing applicant and included in the cost estimate.</li>\n<li>Edging kerb or similar approved will normally be required as a demarcation between the back of footway/highway boundary and property frontage boundary.</li>\n<li>Utility covers/manhole covers within a vehicle crossing should be to the required specification/standard for vehicles to override (to be supplied by the relevant utility company as required). All work to utility covers/boxes/chambers should be carried out by relevant utility company (e.g. cover supply replacement/adjustment/ lowering etc.) to ensure that work is carried out in accordance with utility company’s requirements, specification and standards. Utility mains/services/equipment and plant may require lowering/repositioning/replacing as a result of a vehicle crossing<br />\napplication. Again, all such work will be carried out by the relevant utility company. The cost(s) for any utility works required will be charged to the vehicle crossing applicant and included in the cost estimate.</li>\n<li>Kerbing to vehicle crossings to match existing general ‘kerb type’ in the road where possible/practicable (e.g. granite kerbs/setts/conservation kerbs).</li>\n<li>Where an Access Protection Marking (APM) is to be installed, it will extend to the whole length/width of the vehicle crossing (from top of transition kerb to top of transition kerb), including across the whole length/width of shared vehicle crossings. It will not be permitted to install an APM to part/half of a vehicle crossing, even where there is a shared vehicle crossing (Refer to Council’s Access Protection Marking Policy).</li>\n<li>There may well be other site specific factors/requirements which need to be taken into account with a vehicle crossing application. These will be identified and considered as appropriate and will be at the Council’s discretion.</li>\n<li>All of the above vehicle crossing criteria will be considered as part of the site assessment.</li>\n<li>The Council’s decision on a vehicle crossing application is final, in its<br />\ncapacity as the Local Highway Authority.</li>\n<li>The vehicle crossing application fee is non-refundable. Applicants are<br />\nadvised to first check that their application meets the various criteria of this vehicle crossing policy before submitting it to the Council.</li>\n<li>The conditions above may be periodically reviewed and subject to change following consultation and Committee approval. Any breach of the conditions may result in formal action being taken.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Our Discretionary Council Tax Support Payment Policy is an associated policy to this scheme and is designed to meet the Council’s commitment towards helping vulnerable people within our area.</p>\n<p>The Discretionary Council Tax Support Payment Policy is distinct from the exercise of the Council’s power under Section 13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 which allows the Council to make any further reduction to the Council Tax bill of an individual dwelling at the discretion of the Council. In exercising discretion whether to grant a discretionary payment under this policy, the Council will have regard to the needs of vulnerable groups, and in particular, the Council’s obligations under the Equality Act 2010, the Child Poverty Act 2010, Housing Legislation (1996 and 2002 Acts) and the Armed Forces Covenant.</p>\n<h2>12.

    "content": "<h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments provide additional financial support for claimants of Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit who are deemed by the Council to be in severe financial hardship or have exceptional circumstances, and need further assistance to meet their housing costs.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments can be paid in a lump sum or a series of payments to the applicant or a third party (such as a landlord) at the discretion of Reading Borough Council.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments are paid from a limited budget, and each decision is made based on information and evidence supplied with the application on its own merits. However, consideration will also be given to the remaining cash limit set by the Secretary of State, and the extent that a Discretionary Housing Payment can be used to assist the applicant.</p>\n<p>Due to the implications of the wider welfare reform changes, the Council will have to carefully target Discretionary Housing Payments to those people deemed to be in most need, which means that not all applications for additional discretionary payments under this scheme will be successful.</p>\n<p>In order to manage the Discretionary Housing Payment budget as effectively as possible we have introduced conditions to the majority of Discretionary Housing Payment awards, the use of conditionality has been perceived as good practice in most Local Authorities.</p>\n<p>Conditions ensure that claimants know what steps to take, and how to improve their situation and reduce their need for a further Discretionary Housing Payments. Where conditions have not been met, a further award may not be made.</p>\n<p>The Discretionary Housing Payment scheme is totally separate to Universal Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support. Reading Borough Council has a separate Discretionary Council Tax Support Payment scheme for assistance towards Council Tax liability.</p>\n<h2>2. Statement of objectives</h2>\n<p>Our Discretionary Housing Payment Policy has the following key objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To prevent homelessness by sustaining tenancies;</li>\n<li>To help people who have demonstrated they need additional financial support on account of medical grounds or on grounds of disability to meet their housing costs;</li>\n<li>To help people through personal crisis or difficult events who are facing severe financial hardship;</li>\n<li>To help people who are deemed to be facing severe financial hardship or difficult circumstances, as a result of the wider welfare reform changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Priority and non-priority groups have been established to ensure that the most vulnerable applicants are safeguarded and assisted with longer term awards. Short-term awards will be made to applicants falling outside the priority groups whilst advice and assistance is provided on what options are available to them and conditions put in place that they must meet to reduce their reliance on a Discretionary Housing Payment.</p>\n<h2>3. Priority groups</h2>\n<p>Priority Groups are defined as:</p>\n<p>People with health or medical problems who need access to local medical services or support that might not be available elsewhere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People with disabilities who receive informal care and support in their current neighbourhood from family and friends which would not be available in a new area. In this respect we would also consider families who have a child with a disability who rely heavily on local support networks.</li>\n<li>Vulnerable adults who have lived in the area for a long time and would find it difficult to establish support networks in a new area.</li>\n<li>Severely disabled tenants in substantially adapted properties.</li>\n<li>People requiring an extra room for a member of the family for medical reasons in line with the Council’s Allocations Scheme.</li>\n<li>People approaching Pension Credit age (up to 6 months before pension age).</li>\n<li>Pregnant women expecting their first child who require an extra room (up to 6 months prior to due date).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Non-priority groups</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments made to applicants outside the priority groups will have conditionality attached in the majority of cases, and will be for a short period.</p>\n<p>Non-priority applicants may be expected to attend a Debt Advice appointment as part of the assessment process.</p>\n<p>Any conditionality will be linked to increasing the applicant’s income, reducing their rental liability, bidding for, or finding alternative accommodation or reducing other outgoings.</p>\n<p>Examples of types of conditionality could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attending work related coaching with one of the Council’s partners;</li>\n<li>Actively looking for work, with or without the support of the Council, or one of our partners;</li>\n<li>Registering for housing and bidding for suitable properties in each cycle;</li>\n<li>Making use of HomeSwapper for mutual exchanges;</li>\n<li>Paying rent arrears;</li>\n<li>Receiving and acting on debt advice to increase income, reduce outgoings and prioritising debts from an organisation that qualified to provide debt advice;</li>\n<li>Engaging and acting on advice from specialist support services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The intention of any conditionality is to assist applicants to improve their situation and reduce their reliance on Discretionary Housing Payments; it is not a punitive measure.</p>\n<p>When making a repeat application, the applicant must have met the conditions applied to their previous award, and be able to set out what actions they have undertaken as a result of that support, and explain their next steps in order to reduce their reliance on Discretionary Housing Payment awards.</p>\n<p>Such applications may require an interview with a member of Reading Borough Council’s Debt Advice Team who will also consider the circumstances of each individual case before any further award can be made.</p>\n<h2>5. Criteria for an award</h2>\n<p>Before a Discretionary Housing Payment can be considered, the applicant must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be receiving Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit for the period assistance is being applied for; and</li>\n<li>Complete a Discretionary Housing Payment application (including income and expenditure details); and</li>\n<li>Have a shortfall between the amount of Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit and their housing costs; and</li>\n<li>Be considered to need additional help with their housing costs; and</li>\n<li>Must demonstrate that they require additional financial assistance under this scheme, providing any supplementary information, including medical evidence, where applicable, to support their application; and</li>\n<li>Explain what other options they have considered to try and meet the shortfall in their housing costs, such as:<br />\na) Receiving Debt Advice;<br />\nb) Reducing non-essential expenditure;<br />\nc) Ensuring all eligible welfare benefits have been claimed;<br />\nd) Increasing their hours of work;<br />\ne) Receiving a contribution from other adults living in the property;<br />\nf) Renegotiating their rent with their landlord;<br />\ng) Moving to cheaper suitable alternative accommodation;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When reapplying for a Discretionary Housing Payment after conditions have been set, the claimant must provide details/evidence that conditions have been met within the specified timescale. Failure to do so will mean the application is unsuccessful.</p>\n<h2>6. Examples where Discretionary Housing Payments will be considered</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To support foster carers who are deemed to require additional help due to foster children not being recognised within their Housing Benefit assessment or Housing Costs element of Universal Credit;</li>\n<li>To support young people leaving Local Authority care;</li>\n<li>Where a disabled person’s accommodation has been substantially adapted to meet their needs and where they are deemed to require additional financial assistance to meet their housing costs (this could also include instances where an additional bedroom is used to store medical equipment, such as a dialysis machine);</li>\n<li>To support people who on medical grounds are required to have an additional bedroom within their property for a disabled member of their household, which is not recognised within the Housing Benefit scheme or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit and who face higher housing costs;</li>\n<li>To support households with disabled children who require overnight carer;</li>\n<li>people who are affected by the Benefit Cap;</li>\n<li>To support people who have a reduction in their Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit, due to the social housing under-occupation rules and who are deemed to be experiencing exceptional circumstances;</li>\n<li>Where someone in the household is expecting a baby within 6 months, resulting in the need for larger accommodation, (including those persons currently in shared accommodation or subject to an under-occupation reduction);</li>\n<li>To support ex-homeless applicants settle in the community;</li>\n<li>Restrictions in Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit due to Local Housing Allowance rates, where a person’s circumstances are considered to be exceptional;</li>\n<li>Families with a child temporarily in care who is expected to return home;</li>\n<li>Circumstances where a person’s move away from an area could jeopardise their employment;</li>\n<li>To cover a rent shortfall to prevent a family from becoming homeless, or while the Council explores alternative housing options;</li>\n<li>In circumstances where a person has an unavoidable rent liability on two homes, where Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit cannot be paid on both.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Examples where Discretionary Housing Payments cannot be<br />\nconsidered</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying ineligible service or support charges;</li>\n<li>Paying increases in rent due to outstanding rent arrears;</li>\n<li>Shortfalls caused by sanctions and/or reductions in benefits;</li>\n<li>Where a person does not qualify for any Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit;</li>\n<li>Shortfalls caused by Housing Benefit overpayment recovery;</li>\n<li>Shortfalls caused by overpayment recovery from a Universal Credit award;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>8. Rent in advance, deposits and removal costs</h2>\n<p>The Discretionary Housing Payment budget is insufficient to cover every applicants ongoing rent shortfall. In order to provide long term solutions priority will be given to applicants who are moving to more affordable accommodation where no other funding is available.</p>\n<p>Where the applicant’s current accommodation is unaffordable, a decision will be made if it would be more cost effective to provide financial assistance to help them move to more affordable accommodation, instead of providing short term financial assistance to cover any shortfall in rent.<br />\nWhen considering applications for rent in advance, deposits or removal costs the affordability of the new accommodation will be considered, and any deposit or rent in advance owed to the applicant from a previous property will be taken into account.</p>\n<p>Rent in advance and deposits will normally be paid to the landlord.</p>\n<h2>9. Assessment of applications</h2>\n<p>When making a decision on whether to award a Discretionary Housing Payment, we will take into account the following objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The reasons why the applicant’s circumstances should be considered as being exceptional;</li>\n<li>The size of the shortfall between the rent and Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit, and the reasons for it;</li>\n<li>The length of Discretionary Housing Payment award being applied for;</li>\n<li>The financial impact of any special needs, health or social problems the applicant or their family have;</li>\n<li>What impact not awarding a Discretionary Housing Payment is likely to have on the Council’s finances and services (especially homelessness);</li>\n<li>The amount of money remaining in the Discretionary Housing Payment budget;</li>\n<li>The extent to which the applicant has met previous conditions;</li>\n<li>The impact of any actions that the applicant has taken to contribute towards the difficulties they are facing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When calculating income, Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance (both care and mobility components) and Personal Independent Payments (daily living and mobility) will be disregarded.</p>\n<h2>10. Procedure for making a Discretionary Housing Payment award</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Each request for Discretionary Housing Payments will be considered on an<br />\nindividual basis;</li>\n<li>Consideration will be given to the remaining Discretionary Housing Payment budget, and the extent that financial assistance can help overcome the client’s difficulties;</li>\n<li>Average essential expenditure figures will be used when considering exceptional financial hardship;</li>\n<li>Entitlement to Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit will be checked before awarding a Discretionary Housing Payment;</li>\n<li>A Discretionary Housing Payment will not be awarded until outstanding<br />\nassessments of Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit have been completed;</li>\n<li>Discretionary Housing Payments will not be paid while entitlement to Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit is suspended;</li>\n<li>The start date of a Discretionary Housing Payment will be the Monday following the application being received and not back dated, unless there are continuous exceptional circumstances;</li>\n<li>The decision-maker will signpost applicants to other internal departments of the Council, such as Housing Advice or Social Services or to other external agencies if it is considered that this would help;</li>\n<li>A decision will be made within 10 working days of receiving the Discretionary Housing Payment application, along with any supporting evidence;</li>\n<li>All decisions will be notified in writing and will include information on how to request a review;</li>\n<li>Discretionary Housing Payments will be awarded for fixed period of time according to the individual circumstances of each case;</li>\n<li>Longer term Discretionary Housing Payment awards will end at the end of each financial year;</li>\n<li>The amount of the award and the period it covers will be decided by Reading Borough Council;</li>\n<li>When a Discretionary Housing Payment ends, the applicant will have to reapply by completing a new application;</li>\n<li>A repeat Discretionary Housing Payment application will be considered afresh, and not automatically re-awarded;</li>\n<li>Where appropriate the applicant will be expected to provide evidence that they have looked for alternative accommodation, sought advice or tried to increase their income;</li>\n<li>A Discretionary Housing Payment may be refused if the applicant has not followed instructions or advice. For example, contact and work with their Housing Officer, actively look for less expensive or smaller accommodation or seek employment;</li>\n<li>Where the Discretionary Housing Payment budget is exhausted prior to the end of the financial year 2018/19, it will not be possible for us to award any further payments under this policy even where an applicant meets the qualifying criteria;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>11. Who can claim Discretionary Housing Payments?</h2>\n<p>In most cases the person claiming Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit will make the application for Discretionary Housing Payments. However, we will also accept applications from someone acting on behalf of the person concerned, such as an appointee or advocate if the applicant is vulnerable and requires support or they have requested someone to act on their behalf.</p>\n<p>In all cases the applicant must provide the information requested on the Discretionary Housing Payment application form which includes income and expenditure details, and an explanation of the applications situation.</p>\n<h2>12. How to claim Discretionary Housing Payments</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments can be claimed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contacting Reading Borough Council’s Customer Services Team on 0118 937 3707 or by visiting customer services on the ground floor of the Civic Centre, or;</li>\n<li>Completing the <a href=\"https://reading-self.achieveservice.com/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-09fa4df3-0876-4372-88ba-2cad4b0478f4/AF-Stage-3693a400-54d6-451d-b220-9f072c7c24cb/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2F&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2F&amp;category=AF-Category-0c39d40f-83aa-4cef-9790-1719ad0c268a\">online application form</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>13. Who we can pay the Discretionary Housing Payments to</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments will generally be paid directly to the person claiming the Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit, or the landlord/company their Housing Benefit or Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit is paid to.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payment for Council tenants will be credited directly to their rent account.</p>\n<h2>14. When does the application have to be made?</h2>\n<p>There are no set rules regarding when a Discretionary Housing Payment application can be made. An application can only be considered when Housing Benefit or the Housing Costs Element of Universal Credit is in payment.</p>\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payment applications should be made as soon as the need arises as backdated payments will only be awarded in exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>A Discretionary Housing Payment award will end if a claimant migrates from Housing Benefit to Universal Credit, a new Discretionary Housing Payment application will be required from the date Universal Credit Housing Costs Element was applied for.</p>\n<h2>15. Discretionary Housing Payment disputes</h2>\n<p>Where the applicant is dissatisfied with a decision they will need to write to the Entitlement and Assessment Team within one month of the date of notification and request a stage one review of the decision.</p>\n<p>The letter must state why they disagree with the decision made and, if necessary, provide reasonable evidence. A different Officer will consider the request and any new evidence or information within a month, and request additional information or evidence before making a decision.</p>\n<p>Where additional information or evidence is not provided, the review will be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Once the decision has been reviewed a letter will be sent advising whether the original decision has been revised or the grounds why the review was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>If the applicant is dissatisfied with the outcome of the stage one review, they will need to write to the Entitlement and Assessment Team within one month of the stage one decision notification to request a stage two review.<br />\nThe letter must state why they still disagree with the decision made and, if necessary, provide reasonable evidence.</p>\n<p>A review panel formed by Council representatives will consider the stage two review request, and any new evidence or information and make a final decision within a month regarding the person’s application for Discretionary Housing Payments.</p>\n<p>Once the review panel has considered the stage two review a letter will be sent advising whether the decision has been revised or the grounds why the review was unsuccessful. This will be the final stage of the dispute process.</p>\n<p>There is no right of appeal to a Social Security Tribunal against the Council’s decision to disallow an application for Discretionary Housing Payments. The route of judicial review is available, and the local government ombudsman if a person considers there to be maladministration.</p>\n<h2>16. Change of Circumstances</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of a Discretionary Housing Payment award, a person will still be under a duty to notify the Entitlement and Assessment Team of all relevant changes in their circumstances, in line with the same reporting requirements they have with their Housing Benefit claim or Universal Credit claim.</p>\n<p>Our benefit notifications will also outline specific changes of circumstances that a person will need to report, since this may affect their Discretionary Housing Payment award or the period for which it is granted.</p>\n<p>The Council may revise a Discretionary Housing Payment award if the applicant’s circumstances change.</p>\n<h2>17. When we will stop paying Discretionary Housing Payments</h2>\n<p>We will stop paying Discretionary Housing Payments when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is deemed that a person no longer requires Discretionary Housing Payments following an in-year change in their circumstances; or</li>\n<li>Discretionary Housing Payments are paid due to an official error; or</li>\n<li>The Council decides that a person has misrepresented their circumstances or failed to disclose a relevant material fact, in relation to their application for Discretionary Housing Payments; or</li>\n<li>Entitlement to Housing Benefit ends or housing costs element within Universal Credit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>18. Overpaid Discretionary Housing Payments</h2>\n<p>The Council will decide if it is appropriate to recover an overpayment of Discretionary Housing Payment, and will make every effort to minimise overpayments of Discretionary Housing Payment.</p>\n<p>Overpaid Discretionary Housing Payments will be recovered where it is held that the applicant, or a person acting on their behalf, has misrepresented their circumstances or where they have failed to disclose a relevant material fact.</p>\n<p>We may also seek to recover overpaid Discretionary Housing Payments if we establish that payments have been made as a result of an error made when the claim was first determined.</p>\n<p>Where it is decided to recover an overpaid Discretionary Housing Payment the Council will issue an invoice to the person that received the Discretionary Housing Payment. The Council will consider reasonable repayment plans where appropriate.</p>\n<p>A written explanation of how the overpayment occurred, and the periods and amounts to which it relates will be sent accordingly. Discretionary Housing Payment overpayments will not be recovered from payments of Housing Benefit or the Housing Element of Universal Credit, but may be recovered from any future Discretionary Housing Payment awards.</p>\n<p>Where the applicant disagrees with a decision to recover an overpayment they will need to follow the Discretionary Housing Payment dispute progress above.</p>\n<h2>19. Policy review</h2>\n<p>This policy will be reviewed annually, or in response to any legislative changes, welfare reform or other factors that impact on its effectiveness.</p>\n<h2>20. Governing legislation</h2>\n<p>Discretionary Financial Assistance regulations (S.I.2001/1167) as amended by the Council Tax Benefit Abolition (Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/458), which came into force on 1 April 2013.</p>\n<p>Article 7 of the Discretionary Housing Payment (Grants) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/2340).</p>\n<p>Universal Credit (Consequential, Supplementary, Incidental and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/630), which came into force on 29 April 2013.

    "content": "<p>Reading Borough Council is responsible for recovering money owed to it in respect of debts arising under the Social Security Administration Act 1992. From April 2013, Local Authorities have been given the power to recover overpaid Housing Benefit by deductions from earnings without the need to apply for a court order. This is done by using Direct Earnings Attachments (or DEA).</p>\n<p>Local Authorities were given this power by The Social Security (Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 2013. The full regulations can be found on this website &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/\">http://www.legislation.gov.uk</a></p>\n<h2>Why we use a DEA</h2>\n<p>Not everyone enters into a voluntary repayment agreement. DEAs give us the opportunity to recover overpaid benefits from debtors who are employed if they either refuse to repay, are unable to agree an acceptable repayment plan or who have defaulted on a voluntary repayment arrangement.</p>\n<h2>Employers have to implement a DEA for the Council</h2>\n<p>You have a legal obligation to do so unless you are a new business (i.e. started trading within the current financial year), or a micro business (having fewer than 10 employees). In such cases you are not obliged to operate a DEA although you may do so if this is agreed with your employee. If you fail to comply with your duties, you could be subject, on conviction, to a fine of up to £1000.</p>\n<h2>If your payroll software has not been updated to allow for DEAs</h2>\n<p>As this is a new procedure, it may be that your computerised system has not yet been updated to deal with DEAs. The Department for Work and Pensions is currently working with the Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals, Employer Representatives and Payroll Software providers in order to develop the right long term solution but until your software is changed, you will also need to follow the instructions below as well as the general guidance in this document. Once your system is updated, the information on this first page may no longer be needed.</p>\n<p>Until your software is updated, if you are using a computerised payroll system and you receive a request to set up a DEA you will need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Manually calculate the amount to deduct from earnings. <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/deaemployer#Amount%20to%20deduct\">Instructions</a></li>\n<li>Manually check whether there are any other orders currently in place &#8211; as the DEA may take priority over these. <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/deaemployer#Other%20court%20orders\">Full list of the orders and how they may impact on a DEA</a></li>\n<li>In cases where the DEA does take priority over another order, consider whether other orders need to cease or deduction amounts be recalculated.</li>\n<li>Ensure, in cases where other orders cannot be applied that these are removed manually from the payroll system and subsequently re-instated once a DEA ceases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If, after reading through this guidance, you still have unanswered queries, please telephone the Customer Contact Team on 0118 937 3707.</p>\n<h2>Direct Earnings Attachments &#8211; background information</h2>\n<p>A DEA has its own regulations which follow some of the workings of a Deduction from Earnings Order (DEO) and some workings of an Attachment of Earnings Order (AEO). A DEA does not replace any of these other orders and you may still receive requests to implement deductions for a DEO or AEO for your employees.</p>\n<h3>Your responsibilities</h3>\n<p>As an employer, you have a legal obligation to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a Direct Earnings Attachment when we ask you to make deductions from the employee&#8217;s net earnings.</li>\n<li>Make payments of the amounts deducted to us by the 19<sup>th</sup> day of the month following the month the deduction is made.</li>\n<li>Keep a record of each deduction taken and the employee from whose earnings it was made.</li>\n<li>Continue to operate the DEA until the balance is paid in full, or your employee leaves your employment.</li>\n<li>Ensure you take the right amount from your employee&#8217;s earnings each week or month and pay it to us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you fail to comply with your duties, you could be subject, on conviction, to a fine of up to £1000.</p>\n<h3>Providing information</h3>\n<p>a)  You have a duty to notify us if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We ask you to operate a DEA for someone who does not work for you.</li>\n<li>An employee for whom you are operating a DEA leaves your employment.</li>\n<li>You are a new business (i.e. started trading within the current financial year), or a micro business (having fewer than 10 employees), as defined in the Regulations. If you are a new or micro business you are not obliged to operate a DEA although you may do so if this is agreed with your employee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must write to us at the address shown on this letter within 10 days if any of the above applies to you. You should also let us know if your business ceases trading.</p>\n<p>b) You have a duty to notify your employee in writing of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amount of the deduction taken, including any amount taken for administrative costs. (see section 6.2 on administrative costs). If this information is shown on their pay slip, it will suffice.</li>\n<li>How that deduction was calculated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must do this (and record it) no later than the payday after the one on which the deduction for the DEA was taken.</p>\n<h2>How to operate a DEA</h2>\n<h3>The notice from the Council</h3>\n<p>This letter (officially called a notice) tells you to apply a DEA for your employee and gives you the information you will need in order to apply it. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name and address and national insurance number of the person from whose wages you will make the deduction.</li>\n<li>If we have it, their staff number, pay roll number or similar identifying number.</li>\n<li>The percentage rates at which deductions are to be made.</li>\n<li>The proportion of their wages which is protected (see section 6.2 (a))</li>\n<li>When to send us payments.</li>\n<li>The address to which you are to send the payments if you are going to pay by cheque.</li>\n<li>Details of the account into which the payments are to be transferred if you are paying us by direct credit transfer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The deductions</h3>\n<p>You will need to check that your employee earns enough to allow a deduction to be made. If he/she does, you then calculate how much to take from their earnings using the information provided by the Council and make the deductions.</p>\n<h3>The payments to the Council</h3>\n<p>Once you have taken the money, you must pay it over to the Council within set time limits. We will ask you to make payments in line with your payroll, so if your employee is paid weekly or monthly, you should pay us at the same time.</p>\n<p>However if your employee is paid weekly you must still calculate and deduct the payment every week, but you can pay us 4 weekly if you prefer. Please let us know if you will be doing this by 0118 937 3707.</p>\n<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you take the right amount from your employee&#8217;s earnings each week or month and pay it to us.</p>\n<h2>Which payments are counted as earnings for the purposes of a DEA</h2>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Which payments are counted as earnings for DEA\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p>What counts as &#8216;earnings&#8217; for DEAs</p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p>What does not count as &#8216;earnings&#8217; for DEAs</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Wages</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Statutory Maternity Pay</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Salary</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Statutory Adoption Pay</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Fees</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Bonuses</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Additional Statutory Paternity Pay</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Commission</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Any pension, benefit, allowance or credit paid by DWP, a local authority or HMRC</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Overtime pay</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>A guaranteed minimum pension under the Pensions Scheme Act 1993</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Most other payments on top of wages</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Amounts paid by a public department of the Government of Northern Ireland or anywhere outside the United Kingdom</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Occupational Pensions, if paid with wages or salary</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sums paid to reimburse expenses wholly and necessarily incurred in the course of the Employment</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Periodic payments by way of compensation for the loss, abolition or relinquishment, or</p>\n<p>diminution in the emoluments, of any office or employment</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pay or allowances as a member of Her Majesty&#8217;s forces, other than pay or</p>\n<p>allowances payable to them by you as a</p>\n<p>special member of a reverse force</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Statutory Sick Pay</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lump sum redundancy payments and pay in lieu of notice</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>If the only earnings your employee receives are those in the right hand column, you cannot calculate a DEA deduction.

For example:</p>\n<p>The employee received one weeks wage and 2 weeks holiday pay. Total net payment for 3 weeks = £850.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£850 ÷ 3 = £283.33</li>\n<li>£283.33 x 11% = £31.17</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total deduction from the net wage for 3 weeks of £850 = £93.51 (£31.17 x 3).</p>\n<h4>k) Rounding</h4>\n<p>The exact amount of the net wage is used against table A &amp; B. If the percentage amount calculated results in a fraction of a penny, it is rounded to the nearest whole penny, with a result of exactly half a penny being rounded down to the nearest whole penny below, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net wage £235.63 per week\n<ul>\n<li>£235.63 x 7% = £16.4941</li>\n<li>Weekly deduction = £16.49</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Net wage £1547.99 per month\n<ul>\n<li>£1547.99 x 11% = £170.278</li>\n<li>Monthly deduction = £170.28</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>l) Administrative costs &#8211; what you can charge your employee</h4>\n<p>For each pay period when you calculate the DEA deduction, you may also take up to £1 from your employee&#8217;s earnings towards administrative costs. You can take this even if it reduces the employee&#8217;s income below the protected earnings proportion.</p>\n<h2>Failing to take deductions or making incorrect deductions</h2>\n<p>If you fail to take a deduction from the employee&#8217;s net earnings when you should have or take an incorrect amount you should correct this on the next payday or paydays.</p>\n<p>Where the incorrect amount is because the deduction was less that the amount specified under the regulations then you should first;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduct the amount required for the current pay period.</li>\n<li>Then include the difference between the incorrect and correct amount for the previous period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where the incorrect amount is because the deduction was more than the amount specified under the regulations then you should first;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduct the amount required for the current pay period.</li>\n<li>Then reduce that deduction amount by the excess previously taken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that if a deduction is reduced in any week or month simply because the DEA along with any other orders in place will breach the protected earnings limit of 60% this is NOT considered a shortfall as described above.</p>\n<p>A shortfall only occurs when an incorrect amount has been deducted in error, or where one or more deductions have been missed.</p>\n<p><strong>Pl</strong><strong>ease also note that the total to be deducted, including adjustments for an incorrect deduction, along with other deductions in place, must not leave the employee with less than the protected earnings limit of 60% for each pay period.</strong></p>\n<h2><a id=\"Other court orders\"></a>If your employee has other court orders against them</h2>\n<p>Courts can make orders that mean you must take money directly from your employee&#8217;s earnings in a similar way to how we ask you to make deductions for a DEA. For example, your employee may have an Attachment of Earnings Order (England &amp; Wales) or a Deduction from Earnings Order (for Child Maintenance). The DEA can be imposed without a court order, but if your employee has any other deduction orders against them there are rules that tell you which money you should take first.</p>\n<p>If your employee has one or more of the following in place, they will take priority over a DEA:</p>\n<h3><strong>Englan</strong><strong>d &amp; Wales</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduction from Earnings Order (DEO) from the Child Maintenance Group (CMG)</li>\n<li>Attachment of Earnings Order (AEO) for Maintenance or Fines</li>\n<li>Council Tax Attachment of Earnings Order (CTAEO)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scotland</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deduction of Earnings Order (DEO) from CMG</li>\n<li>Earnings Arrestment (EA)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Student Loans</h3>\n<p>A student loan repayment also takes priority over a DEA. This applies to both England &amp; Wales and Scotland.</p>\n<p>Once these priority orders have been taken into account in your calculation a DEA will then take priority in relation to other orders or notices <strong>i</strong><strong>n date order</strong>(in Scotland this will be the date they were received). The amount you can deduct will be subject to the available net earnings above the protected earnings limit of 60% of net earnings.</p>\n<h2>If your employee does not earn enough to make the deduction</h2>\n<p>If the weekly or monthly earnings are below the threshold (see table A &amp; B) you cannot calculate a DEA deduction.</p>\n<p>You must tell the Council why a deduction cannot be made by using a Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule.</p>\n<p>You must continue to calculate whether a DEA deduction can be made, each pay period until either we tell you to stop or your employee leaves your employment.</p>\n<h2>Your employee thinks the amount they owe is wrong</h2>\n<p>If your employee thinks that the amount of money they owe is wrong, you should advise them to urgently contact the Benefits Debt Recovery Team on the telephone number at the top of the letter they received about the Direct Earnings Attachment.</p>\n<h2>Your employee thinks the amount of the deduction is too much</h2>\n<p>If they think that the amount you have calculated is too much, you should first check that the amount being deducted is correct according to table A or B, on the basis of their earnings and other orders in place. If the amount is correct, you should explain that you have made the deduction as instructed to do so. If they feel that this is too much for them to manage, you should advise them to contact us.</p>\n<h2>Operating a Direct Earnings Attachment</h2>\n<p>Once you have started operating a DEA, you must continue to make payments to us until we tell you to stop or you have deducted the maximum amount that needs to be recovered from the earnings. We would contact you if the amount deducted should change.</p>\n<p>If there is a change of circumstances which means that you can no longer operate the DEA, you must notify is in writing within 10 days of that change happening. In the first instance though, please telephone us to let us know as we may be able to speed up the administration process.</p>\n<p>If you need to tell us about a change like this, please telephone the Customer Contact Service Team on 0118 37 3707 or e-mail us at <a href=\"mailto:Benefits@reading.gov.uk%20\">Benefits@reading.gov.uk</a></p>\n<h2>Making payments to Reading Borough Council</h2>\n<p>On receipt of a notice to operate a DEA, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make regular payments to us until we tell you to stop or the maximum amount to be recovered has been taken from your employees earnings.</li>\n<li>Pay the amount you have taken from your employee&#8217;s wages over to Reading Borough Council as soon as possible, but no later than the 19th day of the month following the month in which you have taken it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if you take the money on 30th September, you must send it to us before 19<sup>th</sup> October. If you take the money on 1st October, you must send it to us before 19<sup>th</sup> November.</p>\n<h3>By BACS (Automated Credit Transfer)</h3>\n<p>This is our preferred method of payment, because of its security and quick clearance times. When setting up a payment by this method, you will need the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Borough of Reading bank sort code &#8211; 30-91-31</li>\n<li>The Borough of Reading bank account number &#8211; 00271502</li>\n<li>Account Name &#8211; Reading Borough Council</li>\n<li>Invoice number</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the payment is for one employee, enter the employees invoice number. If the payment covers multiple employees, you will need to send multiple payments quoting each individual invoice number to ensure payments are allocated correctly.</p>\n<p>If you are paying by BACS, you will need to send a Direct Earnings Attachment payment schedule to us so we know who the payment refers to. </p>\n<h3>Paying by cheque</h3>\n<p>If you need to pay by cheque, please make it payable to &#8216;Reading Borough Council&#8217; and write the employee&#8217;s LA invoice number on the back of the cheque.</p>\n<p>Please send the cheque to: Reading Borough Council, Civic Offices, Bridge Street, Reading, RG1 2LU.</p>\n<p>If you are paying by cheque, you will need to attach a Direct Earnings Attachment payment schedule to the cheque so we know who the payment refers to. </p>\n<h3>Paying by telephone</h3>\n<p>If your bank offers a bill paying facility and you wish to make a payment using the telephone/internet banking/automated credit transfer, use the bank account details above.</p>\n<h3><strong>Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule</strong></h3>\n<p>For payments by BACS (Automated Credit Transfer) or cheque you must send us a Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule. A blank schedule for you to use copy as many times as you need has been included in this document leaflet. The Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule must include the following details for each person for whom you were asked to make deductions from earnings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their full names (forenames and surname).</li>\n<li>Their invoice Number as shown on the DEA notice you were sent.</li>\n<li>The amount of the deduction (in pounds sterling) that has been deducted or</li>\n<li>The reason why a deduction cannot be made when appropriate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The amount of the automated credit transfer or cheque must be the same as the total amount of deductions shown on the Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule. Please do not send cash through the post.</p>\n<h3>E-mail us the Direct Earnings Attachment payments schedule</h3>\n<p>If you prefer, you can e-mail an electronic copy of the schedule to us at <a href=\"mailto:bankrec@reading.gov.uk\">bankrec@reading.gov.uk</a> and the payment can follow. Please include &#8216;DEA notice&#8217; in the subject of your e-mail.</p>\n<h2><strong>Examples of Direct Earnings Attachment in practice</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Exampl</strong><strong>e 1 &#8211; A weekly paid earner with no prior attachment orders.</strong></h3>\n<p>A person with net earnings of £385 per week will have a deduction of £57.75 per week (in accordance with the deduction rates table at 15%</p>\n<h3><strong>Exampl</strong><strong>e 2 &#8211; A weekly paid earner with an existing attachment order for child maintenance</strong></h3>\n<p>A person with net earnings of £250 per week with an existing attachment order of £60 per week for child maintenance will have a deduction of £17.50 (in accordance with the deduction table at 7%)</p>\n<h3>Example 3 &#8211; A monthly paid earner with existing priority attachment orders.</h3>\n<p>A person with net earnings of £1620 per month should have a DEA deduction of £243 (in accordance with the deduction table at 15%). However, this deduction in addition to the existing deductions of £486, will breach the protected earnings limit of 60%. The maximum deduction we can make in this instance would be £162.</p>\n<h4>Calculation:</h4>\n<p>Earnings x 40% = £648 (maximum amount for total deductions)<br />Existing priority attachment order in place = £486<br />DEA deduction = £243<br />£648 &#8211; £486 = £162 (maximum amount available for the DEA deduction)</p>\n<p>Therefore, although the deduction rates table states that a deduction of £243 should be taken, the protected earnings limit means that the amount will be restricted to £162.</p>\n<h2>Information and advice</h2>\n<p>If you need more information about, or help to operate a Direct Earnings Attachment, please ring Reading Borough Council Customer Service Team on 0118 937 3707.</p>\n<p>We will be happy to discuss any questions you may have.</p>\n<h2>Direct Earnings Attachment &#8211; Employers Checklist</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Does the person named in the notice work for you?<br />YES &#8211; go to 2<br />NO &#8211; tell the Council within 10 days<br /> </li>\n<li>Are you a new or micro business? <br />YES &#8211; contact the Council on 0118 937 3707<br />NO &#8211; go to 3<br /> </li>\n<li>Are there any orders for deductions already in place that will take priority over the DEA and prevent it being set up?<br />YES &#8211; tell the Council within 10 days<br />NO &#8211; go to 4<br /> </li>\n<li>Calculate your employees net earnings for DEA purposes<br /> </li>\n<li>Do they earn enough to allow deductions to be made?<br />YES &#8211; go to 6<br />NO &#8211; tell the Council within 10 days<br /> </li>\n<li>Decide how much of their net earnings will be deducted<br /> </li>\n<li>If you deduct that amount, will they be left with less than 60% of their wages &#8211; the protected amount?<br />YES &#8211; If possible, adjust your deductions level to leave them with 60% of their net earnings OR within 10 days, tell the Council that no deductions can be made.<br />NO &#8211; go to 8<br /> </li>\n<li>Make sure the total amount deducted through this and previous deductions are not more than the total amount stated in the notice.<br /> </li>\n<li>Make the necessary arrangements to your payroll for the deduction to be made.<br /> </li>\n<li>Notify your employee of the amount to be deducted no later than the pay day on which the deduction is made.<br /> </li>\n<li>Pay the amount deducted from your employee&#8217;s earnings to the Council no later than the 19<sup>th</sup> day of the month following the month in which the deduction was made. If paying by BACS or cheque, send the Council a Direct Earnings Attachment payment schedule with details of the payment.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "content": "<p>If you don’t own your home, have few assets and little available income to pay your debts you may want to apply for a Debt Relief Order (DRO). This is a cheaper option than bankruptcy and there is no court hearing.</p>\n<p>If your DRO application is successful most of your creditors won’t be able to take action to recover your debts for 12 months – after this your debts will be written off.</p>\n<h2>Applying for a DRO</h2>\n<p>You can only apply for a DRO through a special adviser called an ‘approved intermediary’. It is not possible to apply directly to the Insolvency Service yourself.</p>\n<p>The Council has approved intermediaries &#8211; contact the Debt Advice Team on 0118 937 2197 for advice and/or to apply.</p>\n<p>To qualify for a DRO you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be unable to pay your debts and</li>\n<li>Your total debts must be £20,000 or less and</li>\n<li>Your assets must be worth a total of £1,000 or less and</li>\n<li>You won’t have a car or motor bike worth £1,000 or more and</li>\n<li>You will have a maximum of £50 a month available income after normal household expenses are taken into account and</li>\n<li>You must live in in England or Wales (or have lived or run a business in England or Wales in the last three years) and</li>\n<li>You can’t have had DRO in the last six years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What debts can be included in my DRO?</p>\n<p>As long as your total debts are not more than the £20,000 limit your debts can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Priority debts (such as rent arrears*, gas and electricity debts with your current supplier, arrears on your phone bill if you need to keep it as an essential service, Council Tax, Business Rates arrears and Income tax, VAT and National Insurance arrears.<br />\n*If you include rent arrears in your DRO your landlord can still take court action to evict you, but they can’t recover rent arrears you build up before your DRO. Please seek specialist Debt Advice before considering a DRO if you have rent arrears.</li>\n<li>Credit debts (such as water rates arrears, credit cards and store cards, bank overdrafts and bank loans, loans from finance companies, catalogue debts, home collected credit, benefit overpayments**, family or personal debts, hire purchase and conditional sale agreements if you are in arrears (you may be able to exclude this type of debt if you are not in arrears), hire agreements, parking penalty charges, mortgage shortfalls (money you owe if your house was sold for less than the outstanding mortgage).<br />\nYou may also owe debts from your small business (such as money owed to employees, debts to customers who have paid for goods or services that can’t supply and debts to suppliers).<br />\n**Benefit overpayments can’t be recovered by any method, including deductions from your ongoing benefits, if they are included in a DRO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>If you miss a creditor</h3>\n<p>You can&#8217;t add more debts after you have submitted your application. If you aren’t sure what debts to include contact the Debt Advice Team.</p>\n<p>Any creditors missed from your DRO application can continue to take action to recover the money you owe them and you will need to negotiate repayments separately with them. If this happens contact the Debt Advice Service.</p>\n<p>If a missed debt takes your total debts over £20,000 the Official Receiver may end or ‘revoke’ your DRO.</p>\n<h3>Excluded debts</h3>\n<p>Some debts do not count towards your £20,000 limit including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magistrates’ court fines</li>\n<li>Maintenance, Child Support Agency (CSA) and Child Maintenance Service (CMS) payments and arrears</li>\n<li>Student loans</li>\n<li>Budgeting loans and crisis loans</li>\n<li>Money owed under a ‘criminal confiscation order’ and debts incurred through fraud</li>\n<li>Debts resulting from certain personal injury claims against you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though they don’t count towards your DRO you must list these debts on your application. You are still liable to repay these debts in full.</p>\n<h3>How much does a DRO cost?</h3>\n<p>The Insolvency Service charges £90 for a DRO (you won’t get a reduction if you are on benefits or a low income, but you can pay in installments). The Official Receiver will not look at your application until you have paid in full.<br />\nWe will give you produce a barcoded letter to take to your local Post Office or Payzone outlet &#8211; we recommend that you pay the fee in full before submitting your application.</p>\n<p>If you can’t afford the fee, you might be able to apply to a charity for help.</p>\n<h2>What happens next</h2>\n<p>The Official Receiver will ask a credit reference agency for information about your credit file and check the details in your application before making a decision.</p>\n<p>They will write to you to confirm you have been granted a DRO. They will also write to all the creditors listed in your application. Your creditors can object to the DRO being made, to being included in the DRO or to the details<br />\nof the debt as listed in the DRO, but only if they have valid grounds (for example if you are not eligible for a DRO). They can’t object just because they don’t want to be included in the order.</p>\n<h3>If your DRO stands</h3>\n<p>The qualifying debts listed on your DRO will be put on hold for 12 months. This is called the ‘moratorium period’. You will not usually need to make any further payments on these debts.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions to this rule &#8211; for example in some situations if you have rent arrears. Contact the Debt Advice Team for advice.</p>\n<p>If a creditor included in your application asks you to make a payment you should tell them about your DRO and let the Official Receiver know.</p>\n<h3>If your application is rejected</h3>\n<p>The Official Receiver will tell you and your approved intermediary the reasons.</p>\n<h3>Co-operating with the Official Receiver</h3>\n<p>It is very important that you cooperate with the Official Receiver throughout the DRO process.</p>\n<p>You must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the Official Receiver if any of your circumstances change (including change of address) during the 12 months from the date you are granted a DRO.</li>\n<li>Give information about your finances to the Official Receiver if they ask.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have provided a full list of your debts and assets.</li>\n<li>Tell the Official Receiver if your income increases, or if you come into any money or property during the 12 months from the date you are granted a DRO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cancelling a DRO</h2>\n<p>Your DRO may be cancelled (revoked) if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Official Receiver finds out that the information you provided about your income, assets and debts was inaccurate &#8211; they may also take criminal or civil action against you or</li>\n<li>your circumstances change so much during the moratorium period that you no longer meet the qualifying criteria</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How will a DRO affect me?</h2>\n<h3>If your DRO is approved:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You will have certain debt relief restrictions placed on you – for example:\n<ul>\n<li>You will have to tell your lender you have a DRO if you apply to take out credit of more than £500 and/or</li>\n<li>You will have to tell everyone you do business with the name you used for your DRO if you run a business in a different name and/or</li>\n<li>You won’t be allowed to get involved with the promotion, management or formation of a limited company or become a company director without permission from the court and/or</li>\n<li>You won’t be allowed to hold certain public office and/or</li>\n<li>You won’t be able to apply for a further DRO for six years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your bank or building society may decide to freeze your bank account – especially if you have debt with them. Check with your bank/building society to see if this is a risk. You can open a new basic bank or building society account – but it is up to the bank/building society to decide if they will let you do this</li>\n<li>Your DRO will be recorded on your credit reference file and will be kept for six years. This will affect your ability to get a mortgage in the future because, even after six years, some lenders may ask if you have ever been made bankrupt or had a DRO.</li>\n<li>Your DRO will be recorded on the individual insolvency register (a public register) for 15 months (the duration of your DRO lasts plus 3 months).</li>\n<li>Your job may be at risk if your contract of employment states that you are not allowed to have a DRO.</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "content": "<p>Asbestos is a hazardous natural mineral fibre. Because its fibres are strong and resistant to heat it has been used in a wide range or buildings and products, often for fireproofing. Properties built after the mid 1980s are unlikely to contain asbestos.</p>\n<h2>Why asbestos is dangerous</h2>\n<p>When asbestos is damaged, the fibres can be released into the air. If these fibres are breathed in, they can cause lung diseases. People who have worked with asbestos, or had contact with someone who worked with asbestos, are most likely to be affected.</p>\n<p>Asbestos cement products are considered relatively low risk and are unlikely to release high level of fibres unless they are damaged by extreme abrasion or drilling.</p>\n<h2>Where asbestos is found</h2>\n<p>Building materials containing asbestos were widely used from 1930 to 1980. Houses and flats built during this time might contain it. It is not easy to tell whether a product contains asbestos just by looking.</p>\n<p>In the home asbestos may be found in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>insulating board &#8211; particularly common in 1960s and 1970s housing</li>\n<li>lagging &#8211; widely used in public buildings and flats built in the 1960s and 1970s, usually found in boiler rooms and heating plants</li>\n<li>sprayed coating &#8211; used for fire protection of structural steel during the 1960s, mainly used in service ducts or lift shafts</li>\n<li>asbestos cement products &#8211; found in many types of building as flat sheets for roofing and cladding, often used for garages and sheds</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What to do if you suspect you have asbestos in your home</h2>\n<p>If asbestos is in good condition and not likely to be damaged, you do not need to remove them. To do so would lead to fibres in the air. If you are planning improvements to your home, you should inform contractors of the suspected or actual presence of asbestos. </p>\n<p>Do not carry out DIY work on sprayed asbestos, lagging or insulating boards &#8211; this must be done by a licensed asbestos removal contractor. </p>\n<p>Precautions you should take when working with other asbestos materials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wear protective overalls (disposable overalls that can be thrown away afterwards)</li>\n<li>wear a disposable face mask (&#8216;CE&#8217; marked to EN 149 standard with FFP2 filters)</li>\n<li>keep the asbestos material wet to reduce the amount of dust produced</li>\n<li>work outside if possible</li>\n<li>do not let other people in the work area</li>\n<li>do not drill, cut or disturb the asbestos</li>\n<li>use hand tools rather than power tools</li>\n<li>use an industrial vacuum cleaner to clear the dust (to standard BS 5415 (Type H))</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removing asbestos</h2>\n<p>Asbestos materials that are badly damaged can release dust and should be removed. Some materials high in asbestos content, such as sprayed asbestos, lagging or insulating boards, must be removed by contractors with special licences. </p>\n<p>There is a special area at the recycling centre (tip) for the disposal of asbestos cement. You must contact the centre before taking asbestos there. Small amounts of wast should be wetted and placed in a strong plastic bag for disposal. Large asbestos cement sheets should not be broken up. They should be wrapped in polythene and disposed as asbestos waste. </p>\n<p>Asbestos materials should never be put in as ordinary domestic waste.</p>\n<p>The property owner is responsible for the safe disposal of asbestos. Any contractors employed by you should comply with all relevant legislation enforced by the <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/\">Health and Safety Executive</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Dampness can occur in homes for many reasons. It can lead to mould and mites, problems keeping your home warm and damage to the building.</p>\n<h3>Causes of damp</h3>\n<p>There are many causes of damp, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leaking pipes and overflows</li>\n<li>rain water entering through holes in the roof</li>\n<li>blocked or damaged guttering</li>\n<li>rising damp caused by a defective or missing damp course</li>\n<li>gaps in the external walls or around the windows</li>\n<li>in newly built homes, water used in construction may still be drying out</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These problems often leave a tide mark or coloured stains. The cause of the damp should be repaired as soon as possible. You will then need to dry the dampness out.</p>\n<p>If you see black mould growing this is likely to be caused by condensation.</p>\n<h3>Condensation</h3>\n<p>When air gets colder it holds less moisture and this makes tiny drops of water form. Condensation usually happens in cold weather on both wet and dry days. It occurs on cold surfaces and in areas with little air movement. Signs of condensation include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>water forming on windows</li>\n<li>mould growth on window frames</li>\n<li>damp and mould forming on external walls</li>\n<li>mould forming in areas behind large pieces of furniture</li>\n<li>mouldy clothes</li>\n<li>mould growing in corners of rooms and where walls and ceilings meet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also a type of condensation called interstitial condensation. This happens when warm, moist air soaks into a wall, ceiling or floor before hitting a cold surface within. The air quickly cools and water is left as dampness on the surface. This can look like rising damp. Interstitial condensation can lead to rot and corrosion.</p>\n<h4>Avoiding condensation</h4>\n<p>Produce less moisture by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drying washing outside &#8211; if you need to dry clothes indoors, do it this in the bathroom with the extractor fan on or a window open</li>\n<li>venting non-condenser tumble dryers to the outside</li>\n<li>opening the window to allow moist air to escape after a bath or shower</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also important to ventilate your home without causing draughts. You can do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>opening a window of the room you are using a small amount</li>\n<li>using a cooker hood that vents to the outside</li>\n<li>do not block or completely cover ventilation points or chimneys (fit an air brick with a louvred grill)</li>\n<li>ventilate cupboards and wardrobes &#8211; either by cutting a slot in the back or leaving a gap between the furniture and the wall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keeping your home warm will also reduce condensation. You can do this by fitting insulation and draught excluders.</p>\n<h4>Dealing with existing condensation and mould</h4>\n<p>Control mould growth &#8211; wipe surfaces with a fungicidal wash, dry clean mildewed clothes and shampoo carpets. Do not brush mould as this releases spores into the air.</p>\n<p>Remove excess moisture from your home &#8211; wipe water off windows and surfaces as it forms or use a dehumidifier.</p>\n<p>Keep the property warm and ventilated.</p>\n",

People sleep rough in Reading for various economic, local and individual reasons. This strategy explores these reasons and acknowledges that no single factor is responsible; that they are not exhaustive<br />\nor mutually exclusive, neither are individuals exonerated from their own action or inaction.</p>\n<p>Many people sleeping rough will experience different combinations of issues at times in their lives which result in them sleeping rough. Where there is no single reason for its cause, there is no single resolution.</p>\n<p>Rough sleeping numbers increased year-on year, both nationally and in Reading, between 2010 and 2017. In 2018, there was a decrease. In Reading this was by 19% from 31 down to 25; nationally this was by 2% from 4751 down to 4677. A reduction in numbers is positive, but Reading will continue to utilise Council<br />\nfunded outreach and accommodation services and monies successfully obtained through bids to the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government’s (MHCLG) Rough Sleeping<br />\nInitiative and Rapid Rehousing Pathway funds.</p>\n<p>The following principles will underpin the strategy’s delivery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowing there is a long-term, sustainable option for anyone sleeping rough</li>\n<li>Innovation: Creative responses and making the most of existing resources</li>\n<li>Strategic local leadership: Accountability and cross-borough working</li>\n<li>Partnership working: Everyone having an<br />\nimportant role</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The strategy’s key objective is to reduce rough sleeping by half, to 15 individuals or fewer, by 2022 and to eliminate it entirely by 2027 in line with central government targets.</p>\n<h2>The Council’s strategic priorities around rough sleeping are:</h2>\n<h3>Priority 1: Early intervention and prevention</h3>\n<p>To prevent those who are vulnerable to sleeping rough from moving towards entrenched and harmful behaviours and<br />\nlifestyles by intervening as early as possible.</p>\n<h3>Priority 2: Recovery and community integration</h3>\n<p>To ensure that recovery underpins tenancy sustainment as part of a holistic approach to homelessness prevention.</p>\n<h3>Priority 3: Rapid intervention</h3>\n<p>To intervene rapidly when prevention has been ineffective and homelessness is unavoidable.</p>\n<h3>Priority 4: United support and enforcement action in Reading</h3>\n<p>To approach rough sleeping in a way that supports individuals, but that also protects Reading’s resident and business community<br />\nfrom the effects of any associated anti-social behaviours.</p>\n<h3>Priority 5: Provision of information and alternative ways to give</h3>\n<p>To provide steer to our local communities in how they respond to people who are sleeping rough by providing sufficient and accessible information, support and guidance around how we collectively and individually support vulnerable people</p>\n<p>Download the full <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Rough_Sleeping_Strategy_2019_-_2024_FINAL.pdf\">Rough Sleeping Strategy 2019 &#8211; 2024</a>.</p>\n",

The aim of the Covenant is to encourage all parties within a community to offer support to the local Armed Forces community &#8211; including veterans &#8211; and make it easier for services personnel, families<br />\nand veterans to access the help and support available.</p>\n<h2>Before you leave the forces</h2>\n<p>If you are likely to need advice and assistance to find accommodation you should contact the Homeless Prevention Service straightaway.</p>\n<p>We will assess your situation and give you advice on your options so you can make an informed decision about your housing.</p>\n<p>Six months before you leave the forces, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) will give you a Certificate of Cessation of Entitlement with the date that you will stop being entitled to forces accommodation. You should give this to the Homeless Prevention Service as soon as it is issued.</p>\n<h3>Joint Service Housing Advice Office (JSHAO)</h3>\n<p>You can also contact the JSHAO for advice on your civilian housing options at any time during your career. Call 01252 787574 or attend one of their civilian housing options briefs delivered across the UK, Germany and Cyprus each year.</p>\n<p>The JSHAO also runs the MOD referral scheme which may help you to find a housing association home. You can apply if you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>married or a separated spouse still in services family accommodation (SFA)</li>\n<li>single and living in a hostel within 6 months of leaving the forces</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>If you are homeless or at risk of homelessness</h2>\n<p>If you have already left the armed forces and are homeless or threatened with homelessness you should immediately get in touch with the Homeless Prevention Service. We will assess your situation and work with you to create a personalised housing plan which will include your housing options.</p>\n<p>As someone who has been in the armed forces you may be entitled to emergency accommodation. Emergency accommodation can be provided if we assess you as being in priority need. You will normally have a priority need if you, or someone in your household:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is pregnant</li>\n<li>has dependent children who normally live with you</li>\n<li>has been made homeless by an emergency such as flood or fire</li>\n<li>is vulnerable as a result of any physical/mental conditions, a learning disability or due to your time spent and experiences of the armed forces</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your housing options</h2>\n<p>We will discuss options that are appropriate for you and your household. The demand for all forms of housing in Reading is very high therefore you should explore all the housing options which are available to you.</p>\n<p>Your options may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Looking for <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/private-renting/\">private rented accommodation</a> &#8211; you should consider the size and type of accommodation you need for your household and how much rent you can afford. Most landlords will ask for a cash deposit (in case you fail to pay your rent or cause damage to their<br />\nproperty). If you don&#8217;t have a deposit we may be able to help either through the Rent Guarantee Scheme or by lending you the money to pay a cash deposit direct to your landlord.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/rent-guarantee-scheme-rgs/\">Rent Guarantee Scheme</a> (RGS) &#8211; this scheme helps households on low incomes into private rented accommodation. We pay the rent to your landlord and provide a deposit guarantee (instead of a cash deposit). The scheme removes the needs for a guarantor because the Council guarantee the rent to the landlord for the duration of the tenancy. You must pay your rent to us and save for your own deposit.</li>\n<li>Applying to <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/find-a-home/register-for-housing/\">Homechoice</a> (Reading’s Housing Register) so you can bid for a Council or Housing Association home. As a member of the armed forces you don’t need a “local connection” which requires you to<br />\nhave lived in the Borough for the three years before you apply. You may also qualify for an “additional preference” which could give you higher priority for rehousing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Help with housing costs</h2>\n<p>If you are working and on a low income or if you claim welfare benefits you may be eligible for <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/housing-benefit-and-council-tax-support/\">Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support</a> or <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/homepage/housing/discretionary-housing-council-tax-support-payments/universal-credit/\">Universal Credit</a> to help towards your rent.</p>\n<h3>The Local Housing Allowance (LHA)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-housing-allowance\">LHA</a> limits the amount of benefit/credit you could get towards your rent based on the number of bedrooms your household is eligible for. You can ask for these payments to go directly to your landlord.</p>\n<h2>What other help could I get as a veteran?</h2>\n<h3>Veteran’s Housing Advice</h3>\n<p>This organisation is provided in partnership with The Royal British Legion, Shelter and Connect Assist.

    "title": "Allocations &#8211; full scheme",
    "content": "\n\n\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of this scheme is to issue guidance relating to the allocation of social housing within the Borough of Reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council owns homes across Reading and has nomination rights to Registered Providers’ (Housing Association) homes. In acting as a good landlord and as an enabling Local Authority, the Council is committed to managing and letting social housing in a fair and transparent way to assist households with a need for accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scheme has been developed in partnership with Registered Providers and other interested parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scheme will enable the Council to encourage choice and give capacity to those households eligible for housing who want to engage and be involved in housing decisions that affect their future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, applicants need to have a realistic expectation of the assistance that the Council can provide under its Allocations Scheme. The demand for social housing outstrips the supply and, historically, only a small proportion of applicants are re-housed through the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management of the Allocations Scheme and Information</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Allocations Scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Section 167 Housing Act 1996 places a duty on every local housing authority to prepare and maintain a set of rules which it has adopted, determining the authority’s priorities and procedure to be followed in allocating housing accommodation. This statement is intended to meet that requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scheme sets out those applicants who Reading Borough Council has decided are a qualifying class of person who can join the Housing Register and those applicants who are considered a non-qualifying class of person who will not be able to access the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme also sets out the criteria against which qualifying applicants are considered in relation to reasonable preference and additional preference categories. It also identifies reasons when individual applicants, who may have a reasonable or additional preference, could be considered to have No Priority for Housing depending on their circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full scheme will be made available to inspect at the Civic Offices or on the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/allocationsscheme\">www.reading.gov.uk/allocationsscheme</a>. A summary of the scheme can also be provided on request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consultation will be carried when any major changes made to the content of the scheme are proposed, to ensure that those affected have input. This will include consultation with Registered Providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Head of Housing and Neighbourhoods is the lead officer with delegated authority to allocate housing accommodation under Part VI of the Housing Act 1996.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering exceptional circumstances, decision will be made by the Housing Needs Manager. This will be considered following a request from either an applicant or a member of staff. These decision will be recorded and reasons provided to evidence the outcome of the decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Elected members&#8217; involvement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Allocation of Housing (Procedure) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/483) prevent an elected member from being part of a decision-making body at the time an allocation decision is made, when either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The accommodation concerned is situated in their division or electoral ward, or</li><li>The person subject to the decision has their sole or main residence</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not prevent an elected member from representing their constituents in front of the decision-making body or from participating in the decision-making body’s deliberations prior to its decision. The regulations also do not prevent elected&nbsp; members’ involvement in policy decisions that affect the generality of housing accommodation in their division or electoral ward rather than individual allocations; for example, a decision that certain types of properties should be prioritised for older people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What we do with Personal Information</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any information provided by an applicant will <em>only </em>be used and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The information will be used to process an application for housing, develop our business and provide statistical information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information given by the applicant, in support of his/her request for housing may be cross checked against other information held about him/her within the Council. We will notify offender managers regarding the appropriateness of accommodation offered to prison leavers or ex-offenders who have disclosed information regarding their offending backgrounds. Equally, if a registration form or home visit raises either Child Protection or Vulnerable Adult concerns, then Reading Borough Council may refer to either Children’s or Adult Services regarding these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information held may also be shared with other housing and/or care providers to ensure a suitable and successful allocation of housing. This information will be shared with consent from the applicant, provided on the Homechoice Registration Form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council may also contact agencies for information relevant to assessing the application. This may include, for example: the Home Office in relation to an applicant’s asylum status, current and previous landlords or mortgage companies and support agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An applicant will, on request, be shown and be given personal information relating to their application in line with a ‘Subject Access’ request under the Data Protection Act. Information will not be disclosed to third parties unless there is a valid request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Furthermore, information that has been provided</p>\n\n\n\n<p>by a third party will not be disclosed to the applicant. For example, where a GP has provided medical information regarding the applicant to the local authority, this information would not be disclosed to the applicant unless the GP agreed to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Statement of Fair Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with the Data Protection Act 1988, we will process applicants’ information for the purpose of assessing housing need, collecting statistical information and to improve our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may also use this information to detect and prevent fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal information will be stored electronically and this will comply with our Data Protection policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full details of our Fair Processing Notice can be found on the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/dataprotection/data-protection-housing/\">www.reading.gov.uk/council/dataprotection/data-protection-housing/</a>Statement of the Scope of Applicants’ Choice</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Reading, the demand for Council and Registered Provider accommodation outstrips the level of supply. This means that the Council is not in a position to offer such accommodation to everyone on the Housing Register who expresses an interest and so, broadly speaking, offers of accommodation will be made to those applicants who have the highest priority for housing under the Allocations Scheme. In addition, this means that the primary aim of the scheme is to house those with the greatest housing need. In order to meet this aim the Allocations Scheme underpins the element of choice by allowing an applicant to express their interest in properties that are advertised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who are considered qualifying persons on the Housing Register will be placed in a priority band according to their housing circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Staff Applying For Social Housing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council staff applying for housing, particularly those working in the Housing Service, will need to make it known to a senior member of staff that they intend to apply for social housing and must complete the Declaration of Interest part of the form. This will ensure that the application process is transparent and confidentiality rules are followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legislation, Policy and Guidance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This document makes reference to the legal requirements and policies that must be adhered to. We have had regard to legislation including (but not limited to) the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Housing Act 1996, Part VI and VII as amended</li><li>Localism Act 2011</li><li>Tenancy Strategy 2013 &#8211; 2018</li><li>Homelessness Act 2002</li><li>Children Act 1989</li><li>Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 (c.49) and 1999 (c.33) and 2002</li><li>Section 19 Freedom of Information Act 2000</li><li>Equality Act 2010</li><li>Human Rights Act 1998</li><li>Data Protection Act 1998 as amended</li><li>Section 17 Children Act 1989</li><li>Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Act 2013</li><li>Housing &amp; Regeneration Act 2008</li><li>Allocation of   Housing  (Qualification  Criteria   for   Right   to   Move)(England) Regulations 2015 (SI2015/967)</li><li>The Allocation of Housing (Qualification Criteria for Armed Forces)(England) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1869) </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme has regard to the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) guidance, the most recent of which being:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Allocation of accommodation: guidance for local housing authorities in England (June 2012)</li><li>Providing social housing for local people Code of guidance (December 2013)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme has been developed with regard Reading Borough Council’s own Strategy and Policy, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Homelessness Strategy 2008-2013</li><li>Tenancy Strategy 2013</li><li>Housing Strategy : Firm Foundations – 2009 &#8211; 2014</li><li>Housing Adaptations Policy February 2011</li><li>Name Change Policy 2015</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud (Offences)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>S.171 Housing Act 1996 makes it an offence for anyone, in connection with the exercise by a housing authority of its functions under Part VI:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To knowingly give false information</li><li>To knowingly withhold relevant information which the housing authority has reasonably required the applicant to give in connection with the exercise of those functions.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The circumstances in which an offence is committed could include providing false information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On an application form for social housing</li><li>In response to a request for further information in support of the application</li><li>During a review proceeding</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This may include any applicant who fails to notify the Council of any relevant change in their circumstances which may affect their application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any applicant found guilty of such an offence will be liable to a fine, which could currently be as much as £5000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ground 5 in Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985 (as amended by s.146 of the 1996 Act) enables the Council to take action to repossess any tenancy obtained by the provision of false information or by the withholding of relevant information, by the tenant or a person acting at the tenant’s instigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Act 2013 identifies tenant fraud as a criminal matter and local authorities have the power to prosecute those who unlawfully sublet their social housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equality and Diversity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council promotes equal opportunities and, in doing so, has developed an equalities plan to underpin equality and diversity in all services that we provide. In line with the provisions of the Equality Act 2010, Reading Borough Council will:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of different</li><li>Promote equality between different groups and have due regard to the needs of these</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our aim is to continue to maintain equality and ensure that we let our homes in a non- discriminatory way based on meeting housing need. We also anticipate that the transparency of this will not let any customers be treated less favourably on the grounds of gender, marital status, pregnancy and maternity, race, disability, sexual orientation, age, faith or gender reassignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council Housing teams will treat all applications for housing in a sensitive and supportive manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Travelling Families</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a duty for local authorities to complete regular assessments of the accommodation needs of Travelling Families living in their area as they do for the rest of the community. Travelling Families will be assessed within the parameters of the housing scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scheme Aims</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main aims of Reading Borough Council’s Allocations Scheme are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To let social housing to households with the greatest need for accommodation</li><li>To let homes in a transparent, applicant-friendly and fair way, ensuring that existing and new applicants are treated equally</li><li>To meet the statutory and legal requirements for allocating social housing</li><li> To produce a scheme that is easy to understand, applicant focussed and is part of the delivery of an excellent housing service</li><li>To make sure that the Allocations Scheme is maximising the use of all social housing provided locally and sub-regionally.</li><li>To ensure that the Allocations Scheme minimises the void turnaround time of void properties</li><li>To make sure that the housing needs of vulnerable applicants and those in priority need are given reasonable preference</li><li>To encourage partnership working with other housing providers</li><li>To promote, create and establish balanced and sustainable communities. To make sure that the use of Choice Based Lettings (CBL) allows applicants to exercise greater control over their choice of housing, increasing the likelihood that tenancies will be sustained</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to help achieve these aims the Council will maintain a Housing Register. This is a list of people registered for housing who are prioritised according to their level of housing need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of an Allocation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council’s Allocations Scheme sets out how social rented housing is allocated to those registered on the Housing Register. Section 159 of the Housing Act 1996 (Part VI) defines an allocation of social housing as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Selecting a&nbsp;&nbsp; person&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; secure&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; introductory&nbsp; tenant&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; housing accommodation held by this authority;</li><li>Nominating a person to be a secure or introductory tenant of housing accommodation held by another housing authority (i.e. one of the authorities or bodies fulfilling the landlord condition mentioned in the Housing Act 1985, s.80) or</li><li>Nominating a person to be an assured tenant of housing accommodation held by a Private Registered</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are not allocations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Transfers of accommodation, unless made at the tenant’s own request</li><li>Family Intervention Tenancies as defined in section 297 of the Housing &amp; Regeneration Act 2008</li><li>Successions</li><li>Assignments</li><li>Property Adjustment Orders</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Any change to an existing tenancy, such as changes to those named on a tenancy agreement, will involve Reading Borough Council offering a new allocation and tenancy agreement, as per the Name Change Policy. This will be carried out outside of the Choice Based Lettings Scheme however the Qualification Criteria will be applied to any  new named tenant. Any agreement to change a current agreement will be made by Reading Borough Council. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview of Choice Based Lettings and Housing Register (operational)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council will hold a Housing Register of qualifying people who wish to apply for accommodation with Reading Borough Council and/or Registered Provider accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On processing all Homechoice Registration Forms that are completed and received, Reading Borough Council will assess the priority and award a band to reflect this (see section 17). Once registered, applicants are then able to register interest in properties that Reading Borough Council advertises, this is known as “bidding” (see section 10.2).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process for Housing Register</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council’s Housing Register is a list of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First time applicants (including those to whom the Council owes a main duty under the Homelessness legislation) for a Council and/or Registered Provider property. Referred to as Homeseeker</li><li>Council and Registered Provider tenants wishing to transfer to other accommodation. Referred to as Transfer</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants must complete a Housing Registration Form and sign the consent section of the form. This gives permission for Reading Borough Council to obtain any relevant information that is required to assist the housing registration process. Applicants who are unable to read or write, or who want assistance in completing the forms, can request an appointment to see a member of staff in the Councils’ offices or at their home, or can be directed towards other agencies that may be able to assist them in applying for housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants must also supply a passport sized photograph of themselves and their partner, along with rent account information if they are a Registered Provider tenant and equity information (the amount gained from a sale of property) if they have previously owned a property. Reading Borough Council may also request proof that the applicant is a qualifying person at this stage (see section 14).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the Homechoice Registration Form has been processed the application is assessed against the qualification and eligibility criteria to ensure that the applicant qualifies and is eligible to register for social housing (see sections 13 and 14).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once eligibility and qualification criteria are satisfied, Reading Borough Council will assess the application for priority based on housing need (see section 17).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicant will receive an acknowledgement letter giving details of the following information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Confirmation of whether qualifying criteria have been satisfied</li><li> Personal Identification number (PIN) – a unique reference number</li><li>Details of the initial band in which their registration has been placed (see Appendix 1)</li><li>Confirmation of the date of application</li><li>Details of the size of property for which the applicant has been registered</li><li>Details of how to obtain further information about the Allocations Scheme</li><li>A Homechoice at Reading user guide </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments of applications to the Housing Register will be subject to a thorough investigation of all the circumstances. As part of the investigation Reading Borough Council may carry out home visits, contact third party agencies (including voluntary sector partners) and will collect evidence where appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any decision not to place someone on to the Housing Register (due to ineligibility or non- qualification), to amend an application on the register, or to remove someone from the register, will be notified to the applicant in writing. Reasons for the decision will be provided and the applicant will be informed of their right to request a review of the decision made within 21 days (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All customers can enquire online regarding their status on the Housing Register on the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice\">www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Annual Re-registration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All Housing Register applicants (including Transfers) are required to re-register annually. Applicants will receive a new Homechoice Registration Form to complete in order to confirm or update previously submitted information; this is to ensure the Housing Register holds accurate information relating to of each applicant’s&nbsp; circumstances.&nbsp; Those applicants that fail to respond within 28 days will be removed from the register.&nbsp; A request for a review of the decision to remove an application can be made (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Change of Circumstances</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All applicants are required to notify the Voids and Lettings Team immediately of any change to their circumstances which may affect their priority for re-housing, for example a change of address, someone joining or leaving their household, the acquisition of property, etc. This may also affect their eligibility or qualification to join the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicant will be notified in writing of any change in their priority for re-housing. When an applicant’s change of circumstances has been assessed, this may result in a change in the applicant’s band. The applicant’s new level of priority will run from the date upon which they informed the Voids and Lettings Team of the change of circumstances, and not from the date of the original application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A change of circumstance may be considered at any stage of the application process, from initial application to receiving a formal offer and may be identified by an officer, for example at a home visit. A change in an applicant’s situation may result in a</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reduction in priority for housing at any stage prior to the commencement of a new tenancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Council has been made aware of a change of circumstances but has not received updated information regarding the change, such as a completed Homechoice Registration Form, the applicant’s band will be reduced until such time as the Homechoice Registration Form has been received and processed (see section 18). This may lead to any successful bid being disregarded, and potentially the removal of any formal offer of accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Process for Homechoice at Reading (Choice Based Lettings)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council advertises properties and applicants are required to bid for those that they are interested in. The bidder who has been assessed as having the greatest need or ‘highest priority’ (see section 17) will be offered the property, provided it is suitable for their needs. When considering suitability of a property Reading Borough Council takes into account whether the physical attributes of the property (factors such as size of the property or access to the property) will meet the needs of the applicant (which could include, but is not limited to, number of household members and mobility limitations).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please be aware that allocation to properties managed by Registered Providers will be subject to their own procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adverts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All adverts will usually include the following information regarding the property:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Type of tenancy offered</li><li>Landlord</li><li>Location</li><li>Type (flat, bungalow )</li><li>Size (number of bedrooms)</li><li>Floor and whether or not it has a lift</li><li>Local amenities</li><li>Type of heating</li><li>Whether it has a garden</li><li>The amount of rent payable</li><li>Whether it is specialist accommodation, such as purpose built for wheelchair users, Supported Accommodation, Sheltered Accommodation or Elderly Designated Stock, i.e. properties that are only accessible for those over a certain age.</li><li>If the property is subject to a Local Lettings policy (see section 3).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council properties and Registered Provider properties will be advertised fortnightly on the Council website and in a free sheet which will be available in public resource centres such as Libraries, Neighbourhood Advice Shops and Council</p>\n\n\n\n<p>offices. Any change to the bidding cycle will be subject to review at any time in consultation with relevant parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adverts will be monitored to ensure that quota queues are met (see section 21). At times, advertisements may be restricted to particular quota queues to ensure that all groups are encouraged to participate in Homechoice at Reading. This is to assist in the development of community cohesion and stability within neighbourhoods. In some circumstances adverts will be limited to specific applicants. This will be to ensure that the Council is making best use of its stock, particularly where there are large sized family units.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bidding</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants can bid in the following ways (further information can be obtained from the Homechoice User Guide or the Council website at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice)\">www.reading.gov.uk/homechoice):</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>by telephone</li><li>online through the Reading Borough Council website</li><li>by text</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants can request assistance from the Council for support with the bidding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will have 7 days to place a bid and will be notified of the closing date for bidding on the advert sheet. Applicants will be able to bid for up to 3 properties per cycle. If an applicant is successful on more than 1 property in the same cycle they will be asked which property they would prefer to be considered for and any other bid will be disregarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sanction for those who refuse 3 offers of suitable accommodation within a 6 month period (see section 24.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those applicants who have been given additional priority as they are considered to be homeless or at risk of violence different rules may apply (see sections 23 and 24).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Registered Providers will manage the bids placed for accommodation that they advertise in partnership with Reading Borough Council, in line with the Council’s Allocations Scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bids will be evaluated to check whether:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There have been any changes in circumstances since the date of application (this may result in an applicant’s priority changing and the bid being disregarded) and</li><li>The successful bidder is eligible<a href=\"#_bookmark0\"><sup>1</sup> </a>for re-housing</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Council believes, through advice and consultation with other statutory agencies, that a bid for accommodation to a particular area could present an unreasonable risk to surrounding residents/tenants or to the applicant, then the Council</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1 Eligible – checks will be made to establish identification, immigration status and address before any offer is made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>will reserve the right to not consider the bid for that particular property. However, the household may continue to place bids for other accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If bidding is unsuccessful, applicants will not be directly notified, rather Reading Borough Council will publish feedback information on successful bids in the previous cycle in each edition of the free sheet and on the Council website. This will include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The number of bids for each property</li><li>The priority band of the successful applicant</li><li>The length of time the successful applicant has been registered for housing in that band</li><li>The applicant type, as Transfer or Homeseeker</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This information will help to inform applicants how frequently certain types of property become available, and the indicative waiting time per area.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Viewing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When applicants have been successful in their bid they will be contacted to view the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to reduce the amount of time a property is left vacant for, an applicant may be expected to view a property with as little as 24 hours’ notice. However more notice will be given where possible. Applicants will receive a formal invitation to view a property with a date and time to attend the property, this may be arranged via a telephone call. If the applicant fails to attend the viewing or respond to the invitation Reading Borough Council will overlook the bid for that property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the majority of cases the top 3 bidders will be offered a viewing of the property and asked to state whether they would accept an offer of the accommodation. An offer will be made to the applicant that has been assessed as having the greatest need (see section 10.4).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will be expected to confirm if they wish to accept the property within 24 hours of the viewing, before being made a formal offer of accommodation. Failure to respond within the time scale may result in the bid being disregarded and the property being offered to the next applicant in priority order.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Offers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If several applicants who are in the same priority band place bids for the same property, the applicant who has waited the longest within the band will be offered the accommodation. If they have been waiting the same length of time in the priority band the property will be offered to the applicant with the earliest date of registration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before a formal offer is made Reading Borough Council will verify the information provided in the Homechoice Registration Form.&nbsp; For verification purposes, applicants&nbsp; will be required to provide specific information such as, but not limited to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Proof of eligibility (see section 13)</li><li> Identification</li><li>Proof of address</li><li>Proof of income </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants are required to supply this information to the Civic Offices within 24 hours of the viewing. If applicants do not provide this information within the time scales, a formal offer will not be made and their bid may be disregarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are any exceptional circumstances that mean that applicants are unable to provide the information requested within 24 hours of the viewing, an extended time can be agreed with the Voids and Lettings Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once all relevant information has been verified a letter will be sent advising the applicant of their offer of accommodation. A date will be arranged for them to sign the Tenancy Agreement at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant refuses the offer or does not provide verification information, the applicant with the next highest level of priority who has viewed the accommodation will be made an offer, for which the verification process will also apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All applicants will become non qualifying persons (see section 14.1) from the date that they receive a formal offer of a Part VI Allocation. If they later refuse the property&nbsp; their application will be reinstated from their registration date and their band restored from their effective date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be occasions when Reading Borough Council will have to remove a property from the shortlisting process. This will only happen in exceptional circumstances, for example, where the Council requires a specific property to help satisfy a legal responsibility. Reading Borough Council will aim to avoid removing properties after they have been advertised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenancy types</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of this section a “secure tenant” includes a person with a flexible tenancy granted under s.107A of the Housing Act 1985 (inserted by s.154 of the Localism Act 2011). The term “assured tenant” includes a person with an assured short-hold tenancy, including an Affordable Rent Property (Affordable Rent, which is assessed at no more than 80% of the local market rent, is not subject to the national rent regime but is subject to other rent controls that require a rent, including service charges).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When allocating accommodation to applicants from the Housing Register, Reading Borough Council will always offer an introductory tenancy (a minimum of 12 months) to those who have not previously been a permanent Reading Borough Council tenant, or a secure tenancy to those who are transferring within our stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the introduction of the Localism Act 2011, many Registered Providers have introduced fixed term/flexible tenancies which are for a certain period of time, normally between 2 – 7 years. These tenancies are also allocated via the Housing Register and, as above, are subject to an introductory period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered Providers are able to offer properties at a different rent level, known as Affordable Rent. This will typically be 80% of market rent. Applicants need to be aware when they are bidding for accommodation if this will be affordable for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More detail on Reading Borough Council’s expectations on how Registered Providers manage flexible tenancies and Affordable Rent is available in Reading Borough Council’s Tenancy Strategy at <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/Housing\">www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/Housing</a> StrategiesandPlans/tenancy-strategy-2013-2018/.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For applicants currently in a secure or assured tenancy and are considering bidding for accommodation with an Affordable Rent or flexible tenancy, it is important to understand the implications on any future tenancy. Please see the following guide:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<strong>Current Tenancy Type</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>The Current Tenancy Start</strong>\n<strong>Date</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Rent on New Property</strong>\n</td><td>\n<strong>Tenancy Entitled to</strong>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\nBefore 1/4/ 2012\n</td><td>\nSocial Rent\n</td><td>\nSecure/Assured\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n&nbsp;\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nBefore 1/4/2012\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAffordable Rent\n</td><td>\nAssured/Secure or Fixed Term (if this is what is being offered)\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n&nbsp;\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAfter 1/4/2012\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nSocial Rent\n</td><td>\nAssured/Secure or Fixed\nTerm (if this is what is being offered)\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n&nbsp;\nSecure/Assured\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAfter 1/4/2012\n</td><td>\n&nbsp;\nAffordable Rent\n</td><td>\nAssured/Secure or Fixed\nTerm (if this is what is being offered)\n</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Family Intervention Tenancy (FIT)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a non-secure tenancy within Reading Borough Council or Registered Provider accommodation which may be offered to those with complex needs. Those families considered for a FIT will be assessed and agreed in partnership with Social Care and other appropriate agencies. The FIT will generally be for a fixed period of time with conditions attached, such as, engagement with relevant agencies and support. They have limited security of tenure, and as such they will be terminable on notice with no need to prove any ground for termination or possession. The aim is to allow households to be supported in order to achieve independence. On the successful completion of a&nbsp; FIT a direct offer may be made to the property being occupied (see section 22).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing Needs Groups</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 2 main groups of applicants on the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Transfer Applicants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Transfer applicants comprise of Reading Borough Council and Registered Provider tenants who register with the Council for alternative social housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Homeseekers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeseekers comprise of first time applicants, homeless applicants owed duties in accordance with the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII) as amended, or those who are not existing Council or Registered Provider tenants. This group could comprise of people living in the private rented sector or with friends and/or family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is not eligible for an Allocation of Accommodation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council Allocations Scheme is framed according to relevant legislation and good practice. Section 160ZA Housing Act 1996 as amended states that the Council shall not allocate housing accommodation to the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People who are subject to immigration control within the meaning of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 unless he or she is of a class prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State or is already a secure or introductory tenant or an assured tenant of housing accommodation allocated to him by a local housing authority.</li><li>People who are excluded from entitlement to Housing Benefit by section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33) (exclusion from benefits).</li><li>Other classes of persons from abroad who are ineligible for an allocation of accommodation, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of</li><li>Applicants who are not deemed to be habitually resident in the CTA (Common Travel Area) or EEA (European Economic Area).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Eligibility can change with a change of immigration status; therefore, eligibility for an allocation of housing will be kept under review. However, the applicant is responsible for informing the Council of any change in immigration status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decisions of eligibility based on an applicant’s immigration status will be made by a Voids and Lettings Officer, who will take into account information from the Home Office or Border Agency, (or other appropriate government department) and apply relevant Legislation and statutory instruments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The registration of applicants on the Housing Register is not an acceptance by the Council that they are considered eligible for an allocation of accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Homechoice Registration Form includes an eligibility declaration confirming that applicants agree that Reading Borough Council neither agrees nor disagrees that they are eligible for assistance at the point of application. The Council may make a decision on eligibility at the stage of application or when verifying an application once a successful bid has been made. If the applicant is not accepted on to the Housing Register they will be advised of this in writing and given information on how to request a review of this decision (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will be asked to provide documentary evidence to prove eligibility for themselves and for all members of their household, at the point that they make a successful bid for accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant makes a successful bid for accommodation and is unable to provide documentation to prove eligibility of themselves and their household, s/he will not be allocated the accommodation and will be removed from the housing register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the proof of eligibility document shows that their eligibility for services was granted after their application date then their application date will be amended to the date that they became eligible which may result in an allocation not being made on that occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eligibility for an allocation of accommodation will only be confirmed at the point when Reading Borough Council has checked all relevant documentation, if required, and is satisfied as to the applicant and their household’s eligibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each case will be considered individually, taking account of all relevant circumstances. Applicants who successfully bid for accommodation but are deemed ineligible for an allocation of accommodation will be notified in writing of this decision. Applicants will have the right to request a review of this decision within 21 days of the decision date (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; considered&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualifying&nbsp; Person&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; Reading&nbsp; Borough Council’s Housing Register?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Localism Act 2011 introduces powers for Local Authorities to determine who will be allowed to register for accommodation locally. Applicants that satisfy any qualification criteria are known as Qualifying Persons. The following qualifying criteria apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have been resident in the borough for 3 consecutive years or more directly prior to the date of their application and are still resident in the Reading area at the point a successful bid is made will be considered to be Qualifying Persons on Reading Borough Council’s Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have not been resident in the borough for 3 consecutive years or more directly prior to the date of the application may also be considered to be Qualifying Persons provided they satisfy one or more of the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Worked in the borough for 3 consecutive years in permanent employment, directly prior to the date of their application and are still in permanent employment in the borough at the point a successful bid is made, regardless of number of hours per week. Location of work is determined by an applicant’s ‘main place of work’. If work placement is split across boroughs, the main place of work must be in the Reading area. If an employer’s head office is in the Reading area, but the location of work is outside the Reading area, the actual location where the work is carried out will be considered as the main place of work.</li><li>Family members who have lived in the borough for 3 years continuously directly prior to the date of their application and are still residing in the borough &#8211; close</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>relatives, being mother, father, sister, brother, children over 18. Other special relations such as grandparents who have acted as guardians may also be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Carers’ responsibilities to a resident in the Reading area &#8211; when there is an identified need for formal care for a person residing in the borough.

Reading Borough Council must be satisfied that there is a need to move rather than a wish and in making this assessment the Council will consider the personal circumstances of each applicant on their own\n<ul><li>This work or offer of work must be:\n<ul><li>Regular work for a minimum of 16 hours per week, this includes apprenticeships but does not include voluntary work;</li><li>A minimum of a 12 month contact at the point of application</li><li>The main place of work is in the Reading borough area</li><li>Unreasonable to access by transport taking into account, the nature of the transport, distance, time and</li></ul>\n</li><li>Any other exceptional circumstances, for example, intimidated witnesses including Protected Persons as specified in Section 82 and schedule 5 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>People who are not Qualifying Persons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The following classes of people are considered to be Non Qualifying Persons and therefore will not be included on the Housing Register.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Those applicants who are under 16 years of</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Those who do not meet the residence criteria as set out in the section</li><li>People who have been evicted from a social rented tenancy for tenancy management issues. Any such applicant cannot apply for a period of 3 years from the date of their eviction – this will include anti-social behaviour and rent</li><li>Those who have become homeless as a result of a Section 8 notice (Housing Act 1988) from Private Rented accommodation on the grounds of anti-social behaviour or rent arrears. Any such applicants cannot apply for a period of 3 years from the date of their eviction unless the full homeless duty is</li><li>People whose unacceptable behaviour would make them unsuitable to be a tenant at the time their application is considered and that possession would be granted by the courts for such behaviour. This will also include the behaviour of other members of the household. Any such applicant will be excluded for a period of between 1 and 3 years from the date that they apply. They are able to submit a new application after 1 year but the Council reserves the right to continue to treat them as a non-qualifying</li><li>Applicants who have refused 3 suitable properties within a 6 month period. Any such applicant cannot apply for a period of 1 year from the date of the last refusal (see section 1).</li><li>Introductory tenants requesting a transfer whilst they have an introductory tenancy. If there is an urgent need to move, then the Council may in some circumstances agree to the transfer. In these circumstances a further introductory tenancy will be offered for the remaining tenancy</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All Applicants will become non qualifying persons from the date that they receive a formal offer of a Part VI Allocation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they later refuse the property without requesting a review of its suitability, their application will be reinstated from their application date and their band restored from their effective date, as long as no sanctions apply (see section 24.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that a request is made to review the suitability of the accommodation offered under Part VI (see section 23.1) the applicant will remain as a non-qualifying person throughout the review process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In exceptional circumstances, the Council may choose not to apply the above criteria when considering an individual application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An applicant will need to reapply at the end of the period in which they are considered to be a non-qualifying person, or if their situation changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Transition to new scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The qualification rules set out above will apply to all new applications from the date of the publication of the new scheme 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016. We will write to all external applicants to advise them they will be removed unless there is an exception. For those who are living in the borough at the point of implementation who applied to join the Housing Register prior to 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016 the residency qualification criteria will not apply. We will re-register all applicants on the Housing Register prior&nbsp; to implementation. For applicants who have previous applied and that application was</p>\n\n\n\n<p>subsequently cancelled, any new application submitted to re-join the Housing Register after 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016 will be subject to the new criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those tenants who are introductory tenants at the time of the transition to the new scheme will be allowed to remain on the Housing Register, however, they will not be allocated other accommodation until their tenancy is secure. Those who have been found guilty of anti-social behaviour or who have been evicted previously due to a breach of tenancy in the social housing sector will be considered on a case by case basis, which could be at shortlist stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is considered to be part of the household including Joint Tenancies?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Who can be considered as part of the Household?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for the Council to decide who can be considered as part of the household, this will be done by considering whether a person is normally resident as a member of the family. When the Council considers requests for housing, it is likely that the following circumstances will be considered:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Partners who are living in a permanent</li><li>Dependent children, including children coming out of Social Services care or children who have been adopted/fostered. When an applicant applies and the application includes children where there is shared parental responsibility, they will be considered as part of the household if the applicant has the main parental responsibility of the child/children and their address is considered the child’s or children’s main and principal home. This may be demonstrated and will be assessed on factors such as, receipt of benefit, address used to register for doctors, schools, etc. frequency of residence (see Appendix 3).</li><li>Where a person moved in with the applicant at the start of the tenancy and continues to reside with the applicant, it will be reasonable to expect that they should reside with the</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who does not meet the above criteria will not normally be taken into account when considering the accommodation to be offered, with the exception of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Dependent relatives &#8211; where a relative of a tenant has had to join the tenant to receive care and there are no other housing options for the family (examples of housing options in these circumstances include where the relative owns their own property, or occupies a property large enough to accommodate the family). Here, a relative means partners, parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces including step relations and half relations. A need for the care that is provided will need to be</li><li>Carers – in certain circumstances applicants requiring a carer will be registered for an additional bedroom. This could be where the applicant requires personal care both during the day and at night which could only be provided by a live-in carer. It would normally be expected that the person requiring the care be in</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>receipt of Carer’s Allowance and Disability Allowance/Personal Independent Payment (PIP) with the highest care component. The carer must be recognised or employed by or working on behalf of Adult Social Care. It would normally be expected that the carer be a named individual unless care is provided on a rota arrangement made by Adult Social Care or agents on their behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When a member of an applicant’s household is in prison, this person may be included in the household 4 weeks before their confirmed release date from prison as long as they were resident in the household prior to their</li><li>Children who are living with their parents and are studying at university during term times, or serving in the armed forces. In these circumstances their parental home will be considered as their principal</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where an eligible applicant has members of their household who are subject to immigration control or where their terms of entry into the UK prohibit them from a reliance on public funds then they will not be considered to be part of the applicant’s household for the purposes of the Allocations Scheme. However, they will be recognised as living with the applicant as part of their household.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joint Tenancies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joint tenancies will be created in the following circumstances:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Where household members have long term commitments to the home, for example, when adults share accommodation as partners, a joint tenancy should be granted. Applicants will be made aware of this option and will also be made aware of the legal and financial implications and obligations of joint tenancies including the implications for succession rights of partners and children. Where a joint tenancy is refused by the Council the applicant/s must be given reasons why.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the creation of a joint tenancy, both tenants must be present to sign the tenancy agreement. In exceptional circumstances the absent tenant may be able to sign retrospectively; however, the circumstances surrounding the creation of the joint tenancy will need to be assessed to ensure it was valid. This assessment will take in to account historic correspondence from each tenant and the reason why both applicants were not able to attend the sign up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In accordance with s.160ZA (1) (b) Housing Act 1996 as amended, a housing authority shall not grant a joint tenancy to two or more people if one of them is a person from abroad who is ineligible. In these situations a sole tenancy will be granted to the&nbsp; eligible applicant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How we decide the size of property required</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council’s Bedroom Standard is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicant and partner &#8211; 1 bedroom (a single applicant may be offered a self- contained studio flat or a one bedroom property)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Each child or adult requiring a separate bedroom for medical reasons (medical evidence is required) &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>Each adult, or couple, 18 years or over &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>Up to 2 children of either sex under 10 years &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>Up to&nbsp; 2 children&nbsp; of opposite&nbsp; sex over and at&nbsp; least&nbsp; 1 child is over 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; 2 bedrooms</li><li>Up to 2 children of the same sex under 18 years &#8211; 1 bedroom</li><li>A carer (or group of carers) providing overnight care &#8211; 1 bedroom</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For applicants who are pregnant, the Council will consider their bedroom need including the unborn child, when they reach 30 weeks gestation. For example an applicant (and partner) who is pregnant can be considered for a two-bedroom property but only three months before the expected date of delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Smaller Accommodation than needed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the overall demand on larger sized accommodation, in certain circumstances, applicants may be considered for smaller sized accommodation than that specified under the Council’s bedroom standard as long as this does not result in statutory overcrowding or compromise children of different sex sharing a room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For example, if a household has been awarded with a 4 bedroom need due to a child being over 18 and there is another child of the same sex under 18 in the household, on request, Reading Borough Council will consider allowing them to share to reduce the number of bedrooms that is required, unless this it is not reasonable to do so, for example medical advice, etc.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will only allow a maximum of 2 children per room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accommodation smaller than required will not be considered as standard, it may be considered by the Council where there are particular problems in re-housing a household or upon request.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How we decide the priority of an applicant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each application on the Housing Register will either be placed in a band or will be considered to have No Priority For Housing. This section will detail how Reading Borough Council determines the priority of applicants to the Housing Register and how the band is awarded as a result. Priority is awarded against 2 criteria, as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reasonable Preference</li><li>Additional Preference</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>o Exceptional Strategic Lettings</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bands</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The priority bands are for the purposes of assessing and prioritising the housing needs of households. The bands reflect a scale of need, with the most urgent cases being in Band A and the least urgent cases being awarded No Priority for Housing. All the housing needs of a household within an application will be taken into consideration when determining the priority band, therefore as a household’s circumstances change the priority band may be reassessed. Reading Borough Council awards cumulative priority which means that, if more than one situation applies to a household, they will attract more than one priority banding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The examples outlined within the housing bands do not represent an exhaustive list. Each case will be assessed on its own merits and placed into the priority band accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appendix 1 details the priority bands and circumstances that would attract a level of priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reasonable Preference Categories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Section 166A(3) of The Housing Act 1996 (as inserted by the Localism Act 2011) states that a Local Authority’s Allocations Scheme shall be framed so as to ensure reasonable preference is given to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicants who are homeless within the meaning of Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (including those who are Intentionally Homeless and those not in a priority need)</li><li>Applicants who are owed a duty by any Local Authority under section 190(2)<a href=\"#_bookmark1\"><sup>2</sup></a>, 193(2)<a href=\"#_bookmark2\"><sup>3</sup> </a>or 195(2) of the 1996 Housing Act (or under section 65(2) or 68(2) of the Housing Act 1985) or who are occupying accommodation secured by any housing authority under section 192(3).</li><li>Applicants occupying insanitary or overcrowded housing or otherwise living in unsatisfactory housing conditions. Unsatisfactory housing conditions will be considered where a household lacks kitchen, bathroom, toilet facilities or heating.</li><li>Applicants who need to move on medical or welfare grounds (including grounds related to disability).</li><li>Applicants who need to move to a particular locality in the district of an authority, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or others). This includes applicants to move under the Right to Move Guidance (see appendix 5)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2 Applicants who are threatened with homelessness and in priority need as defined by the Housing Act 1996 Part VII as amended by the Homelessness Act 2002</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 Applicants who are intentionally homeless and are either occupying temporary accommodation for a short period or entitled to advice and assistance as defined by the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who are in priority need and are unintentionally homeless as defined by the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII) as amended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reasonable Preference categories will not be treated in isolation to each other and will be cumulative. Applicants’ housing needs will be assessed taking into account specific housing circumstances, which fall into more than one category as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND A – Emergency need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 5 or more Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND B – Urgent need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 4 Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND C – Intermediate need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 3 Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND D – Identified need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants within 2 Reasonable Preference categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>BAND E – Low level need to move</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants with 1 Reasonable Preference category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priority will be awarded for medical and welfare issues assessed. Any priority awarded&nbsp; as a result of this will be taken into account in the context of the overall priority awarded to the application. This may not lead to a cumulative increase in priority if it is below that which the application has already attracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Priority for Housing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who are deemed to be adequately housed or those who have been determined as having No Priority for Housing (see section 18).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Preference</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, section 166A(3) of the 1996 Housing Act (as inserted by the Localism Act 2011) gives housing authorities power to frame their Allocations Scheme to give additional preference to particular descriptions of people who fall within the statutory reasonable preference categories, being those deemed to have an urgent housing need. Assessing the need for additional preference will require evidence from relevant professionals involved, such as Police, Social Care, medical professionals, etc.&nbsp; Applicants who may be given additional priority will include but are not limited to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People at risk of serious violence or threats of serious violence that is likely to be carried out, this includes domestic abuse, racial harassment and hate crimes including Management Transfers (see section 7).</li><li>Witnesses of crime, or victims of crime who would be at risk of intimidation amounting to violence or threats of violence if they remain in their current homes.</li><li>Those who need to move due to an urgent medical reason (see section 8).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Prescribed members of the armed forces as follows:\n<ul><li>former members of the Armed Forces within 5 years of discharge</li><li>serving members of the Armed Forces who need to move because of a serious injury, medical condition or disability sustained as a result of their service</li><li>bereaved spouses and civil partners of members of the Armed Forces leaving Services Family Accommodation following the death of their spouse or partner</li><li>serving or former members of the Reserve Forces who need to move because of serious injury, medical condition or disability sustained as a result of their service</li></ul>\n</li><li>Those who need to move due to an urgent welfare issue</li><li>Those who satisfy the Exceptional Strategic Lettings criteria as set out in section</li><li>and Appendix 1 in order to make best use of housing</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional Preference categories will be assessed and a band will be awarded to reflect the urgency of the housing situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Exceptional Strategic Lettings</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional Preference categories include circumstances where Reading Borough Council needs to best manage the housing stock, known as Exceptional Strategic Lettings. There are some circumstances where Reading Borough Council needs to take steps to manage our stock in the best interests of our current tenants and of those waiting for accommodation. In such circumstances, in order to make best use of the housing stock, the Council will award overriding priority. See Appendix 1 for further information on banding priority and section 27 for further information for tools employed to manage Reading Borough Council’s estates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following situations will attract an increased level of priority (see Appendix 1 for detail):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Succession to a property larger than required and legal action has commenced to recover the property</li><li>Tenants of Reading Borough Council whose homes are being demolished</li><li>Tenants of Reading Borough Council whose properties require major renovation, where a decant to a temporary home while the works are carried out is not a reasonable option</li><li>Tenants of a social housing property living in accommodation larger than they need within Reading Borough Council’s area</li><li>Tenants occupying accommodation with major adaptations that they no longer required or occupying accommodation that is in high demand as assessed by Reading Borough Council</li><li>Any other exceptional circumstances</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Under-occupiers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council will facilitate moves for Reading Borough Council or Registered Provider tenants who are under-occupying their property by at least one bedroom. Tenants that are under-occupiers will be placed in Band B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The size of the alternative accommodation they can be considered for will be that which is appropriate to meet the household’s needs (see section 16).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council operates a Tenant Incentive Scheme, which is subject to change, so applicants will need to confirm any current incentive with their housing officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a dedicated Transfer and Under Occupation Officer who will also offer additional support to anyone who requires support in order to ease their move.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Management Transfers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council may decide that a tenant of Reading Borough Council or a Registered Provider (where the resulting vacancy will be made available to Reading Borough Council) be awarded overriding priority for a move either on a permanent basis, or a temporary basis if the tenant requests this whilst waiting for Reading Borough Council to take possession proceedings against the perpetrators of the anti-social behaviour. This would normally be on an emergency basis, for example, where violence or domestic violence occurs which poses a serious threat to their life or the life of their family or where the risk or likelihood of violence is ongoing and the normal actions of an injunction or other legal action cannot be taken or would be unlikely to afford sufficient protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Management Transfer Panel will consider the following situations for overriding priority (Band A):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tenants of Reading Borough Council or a Registered Provider who are at risk</li><li>Reading Borough Council tenancies where the tenant has left the accommodation leaving other family members in situ</li><li>Potential new tenancy following the death of a tenant in cases where there are no succession rights</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, in exceptional circumstances, the Council may decide to transfer a tenant whose application for a transfer does not attract sufficient priority for a move under the Choice Based Lettings scheme, where his/her behavioural problems, or those of&nbsp; someone within the household, are unavoidably causing severe disruption to neighbours or to the household itself. In such cases the Council retains the right to make a direct allocation (see section 22). This situation could occur where a member of the household has anti-social behaviour issues and, whilst engaging with appropriate services, it is considered that a move would reduce the disruption to neighbours and the household concerned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thorough investigations will be undertaken in respect of all the above situations, including liaison with the Police, Social Services and other agencies to establish the degree and severity of the problem(s) being suffered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approved Management Transfers will be reviewed every 3 months, and approved management transfer applicants will be expected to participate in Homechoice. Management Transfer status will be removed if the circumstances change and an urgent move is no longer required. If the applicant is not bidding, despite suitable properties being available, or has refused offers of suitable accommodation, the refusal sanctions will apply (see section 24.1). The property offered will be suitable for the family size in accordance with bedroom need. The Voids and Lettings Officers will monitor bidding activity and will ensure that bids are made in areas that are safe for the applicant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advice on areas considered safe for the applicant will be given at the time the Management Transfer is accepted. Bids made by applicants to areas where there is deemed to be an on-going risk to the applicant or a household member will not be considered and will be overlooked. This will be confirmed to the applicant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger sized family units can be difficult to secure. This is because of limited social housing resources. It may be necessary to consider a range of options when considering these needs and this may include private rented accommodation under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (see section 26.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overriding priority for an allocation may also be given to a person who has occupied a particular property for a long time and who is not the named tenant, but who has a clear need to remain in the property. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Where the sole tenant has left the property, leaving his or her partner and children in occupation, but the remaining occupier is not a named</li><li>The remaining partner/close family member following the death of a secure tenant even when there is no statutory right to</li><li>Spouses, civil partners or cohabiting couples who would have been able to apply to the courts for an order under Schedule 7 Family Law Act</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the property in question is too big for the remaining occupiers, the Council may offer a secure tenancy of a smaller property that meets the accommodation needs of the remaining occupiers following a successful bid made via Homechoice. This allows the Council to make best use of the housing stock. Any tenancy offered under this section will be an introductory tenancy in the first instance. Examples of factors that the Council will take into account when making its decision may include, but will not be limited to the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The length of time the applicant has shared the former tenant’s home</li><li>The length of time the applicant has been a member of the tenant’s family as defined by Section 113 Housing Act 1985</li><li>The vulnerability and needs of the applicant</li><li>The circumstances in which the tenancy was granted or, as the case requires, the circumstances in which the applicant and his partner became a tenant under the tenancy</li><li>The housing needs and housing resources of the applicant and any relevant child</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The financial resources of the applicant</li><li>The likely effect of any decision by the Council not to exercise its powers on the health, safety, or well-being of the parties and of any relevant child</li><li>The nature of the parties’ relationship</li><li>The length of time during which they cohabited</li><li>Whether there are or have been any children who are children of both parties or for whom both parties have or have had parental responsibility</li><li>The length of time that has elapsed since the parties ceased to live together</li><li>The suitability of the parties as tenants</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant’s request for a Management Transfer is refused, or their status removed, they will be advised of this decision in writing. Applicants have the right to request a review of this decision (see section 24.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Housing Assessments in Relation to Medical Conditions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have a medical condition that is being worsened by their current housing may complete a medical assessment form, which is also included in the Homechoice Registration Form. Reading Borough Council will consider the medical assessment form to determine if any further priority should be given to their application for housing. All members of the applicant’s household who have submitted medical information will be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Independent Medical Advisor (IMA) and the Voids and Lettings Team&nbsp; consider housing assessments in relation to medical conditions. The IMA is a qualified GP whose services are provided to the Council so that an independent medical assessment can be made on those cases where such an assessment is deemed necessary. If there is no link between the health of the individual and their current housing, the medical assessment form completed by the applicant will not be submitted to the IMA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Voids and Lettings Team will carry out a home visit in some situations in order to clarify the link between an applicant’s health and their home situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IMA and Reading Borough Council will normally assess applicants, and members of the household where applicable, to ascertain composite need on the basis of the information supplied by the applicant/tenant. In certain circumstances, a member of the Voids and Lettings Team, or the IMA, will contact the GP or other medical professional involved for further advice or to require a visit be made to confirm/clarify information provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be allocated a medical priority the applicant’s illness/disability must be linked to their housing circumstances. For example, difficulty accessing parts of their accommodation because it has not been adapted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In cases where the accommodation occupied has a very severe or life threatening impact on an applicant’s medical condition, a Band A priority will be awarded. In other circumstances, priority will be awarded on a scale to Band E (which would reflect a minimal but recognised impact on an applicant’s health). Where it is assessed that the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>housing situation is not detrimental to the applicant’s medical condition no banding based on medical circumstances will be awarded. An elevation in an applicant’s overall band may not always occur, for example if the band awarded for medical reasons is lower than the applicant’s band prior to the assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain Reading Borough Council and Registered Provider properties have been specially designed or adapted for use by applicants with a disability. In allocating to these properties, priority is given to those who require those adaptations. We will seek advice from an Occupational Therapist on the suitability of any accommodation required for those with a disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On occasions, the IMA will make recommendations regarding the type of property that will be suitable to meet the needs of certain applicants. This information will be provided to the applicant and if a bid is received for unsuitable accommodation based on the recommendations, the Voids and Lettings Team may disregard the bid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IMA or the Voids and Lettings Team may recommend that an application is reassessed. This may be because improvements may have been carried out to the current accommodation e.g. adaptations that should alleviate the medical need or if an applicant’s medical condition deteriorates and they provide further medical evidence. Applicants can request their medical assessment to be reassessed and this may be completed by another medical partner or by the Voids and Lettings Team. However there must be a clear change in the circumstances for an assessment to be reassessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Disabled Applicants – Aids and Adaptations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant with limited mobility wants to remain in their home and it is suitable for adaptations, they can apply to the Renovations Team for a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) to adapt their current home. Decisions regarding DFGs are made by the DFG Panel following the process documented in Housing Adaptations Policy (February 2011), which is available at: <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/residents/housing/grants/disabled-facilities-grants\">www.reading.gov.uk/residents/housing/grants/disabled-facilities-grants</a> It will be necessary to have an Occupational Therapist’s assessment to help the applicant/tenant through this process. It should be noted that, where it is possible to move an applicant to a suitable alternative property, agreement may not be given for adaptations to their existing home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Social/Welfare Scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The social/welfare scheme is designed to assess those situations where an applicant’s accommodation is detrimental to their needs because of social and welfare reasons. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A vulnerable applicant is being exploited within their accommodation, putting them at risk</li><li>An applicant needs to move on from Supported Accommodation into independent accommodation</li><li>An applicant may be capable of, and best suited to, independent living provided that the necessary support mechanisms are in place. Welfare priority will be awarded in order to avoid a residential placement having to be made</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An applicant is in hospital with a discharge date but cannot return to their original accommodation because it is unsuitable</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not an exhaustive list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases are assessed by the Voids and Lettings Team and will be based on evidence received from other professionals in support of the application. The award of priority can range from Band A, where there are exceptional social/welfare issues, to Band D. See Appendix 1 for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Priority for Housing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who do not meet the criteria set out in section 17 with regard to reasonable or additional preference will be considered to have No Priority for Housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be situations where an applicant will have No Priority for Housing even though their application might otherwise attract reasonable and/or additional preference (see section 17). The following is a list of such applicants:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Owner-occupiers, whether the property that they own is in the UK or abroad, unless one of the following apply:</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The applicant, or a member of their household, requires adaptations that are not possible in their owned accommodation; or</li><li>The applicant and partner are over the age of 60 and there is a need for Sheltered accommodation that they are unable to secure by purchasing a property of this type; or</li><li>The property owned by the applicant is in negative equity and their property is unaffordable for</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Each case will be considered individually. The personal circumstances of each application will be taken into consideration and an assessment will be made regarding their financial ability to secure their own accommodation, including private rented accommodation. If accommodation is awarded to the applicant via Homechoice, Reading Borough Council will expect their owned property to be sold within 1 year of the allocation and evidence of this will be required.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicants who have financial resources available to meet their housing costs (section 166A(5) of the 1996 Housing Act) for example: assets, savings or a level of disposable income that could be reasonably applied to securing alternative accommodation in either the owner-occupied/low cost home ownership or private rented sector. Each case will be considered individually, taking into account all relevant financial and personal circumstances of both the applicant and of the housing</li><li>Applicants who have deliberately worsened their living conditions in an attempt to increase their opportunities for re-housing. For example, where an applicant occupies a property, which is suitable for their needs, and relinquishes it for less</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>suitable housing. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band and this could be for a period of up to 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applicants who have had a change of circumstance and have not informed the Council. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band until a new Homechoice Registration Form has been received at which point, following the assessment, priority will be awarded to reflect the new situation. It is the applicant’s responsibility to notify the Voids and Lettings Team of any change in circumstances as soon as</li><li>Applicants who are subject to possession proceedings by either the Council or a Registered Provider, due to breach of tenancy or licence which includes rent arrears and anti-social behaviour (section 166A(5) of the 1996 Housing Act).</li><li>Applicants who are applying to buy their Council property or being considered for other housing options such as Shared Ownership/Homebuy. Such applicants may not be considered for an allocation of accommodation. However, each case will be considered individually, taking account of all relevant circumstances</li><li>Council or Registered Provider tenants where the property and/or garden of their existing home is not in a tenantable condition. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band until the condition of either the property or the garden has improved (depending on the circumstances of each case).</li><li>Council tenants who have made unauthorised alterations to their property and have either not carried out remedial works or have not paid necessary recharge amounts.</li><li>Applicants who have a current or a proven history of rents arrears and/or anti- social behaviour. In such cases the Council may stipulate certain conditions, which must be met. This could be making agreements to clear rent arrears, or adhering to a Behaviour Agreement. Any debt must be legally recoverable for this to</li><li>Applicants who are found to be intentionally homeless within the homelessness legislation. Such applicants will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 12</li><li>Applicants who have refused a direct offer of accommodation will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 12</li><li>Homeless households who have refused a final offer of accommodation will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 12</li><li>Applicants who have received major adaptations to their home via the Disabled Facilities Grant will be placed in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 5 years. If during this time the property becomes unsuitable for the applicant due to medical need this will be assessed on a case by case</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Any successful bid(s) made by an applicant in one of the above groups may be disregarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above groups may however be given priority for re-housing in exceptional circumstances such as serious medical or welfare needs. Each case will be decided on&nbsp; its merits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key Workers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council’s Planning Framework outlines that most affordable housing within the Borough will be socially rented. Of which, a proportion of this accommodation will be exclusively advertised for Key Workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Key Worker definition will vary depending on the grant allocated to Registered Providers for developing the scheme. The Council also has its local definition of a Key Worker, defined as someone who:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lives or works in Reading and</li><li>Is employed by the public sector (Reading Borough Council, Royal Berkshire and Battle Hospital NHS Trust, Royal Berkshire Ambulance NHS Trust, Reading Primary Care Trust, Thames Valley Police, Royal Berkshire Fire &amp; Rescue Service, Reading Buses) and</li><li>Is delivering an essential public service</li><li>Is in a post where there are serious recruitment and retention problems</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In Reading this includes (but is not limited to) nurses and other NHS staff, teachers in schools, further education and Sixth Form colleges, Police Officers and some civilian staff, Social Care workers (which can include Housing Officers), Occupational Therapists, Planners, Fire-fighters, Bus Drivers and ancillary staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key Worker opportunities are advertised via Reading’s Homechoice however they may also be able to register with the Zone Agent which in Reading is the Catalyst Housing Group and who can be contacted on 0845 6017729.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tied Accommodation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to meet the Council’s commitment to making offers of accommodation to those with the greatest need and maximising the resources available, those applicants who live in tied accommodation, including those occupying service accommodation, will not have an automatic right to be offered accommodation, but will be able to register on the Housing Register. They will be assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the applicant loses their right to occupy their accommodation, then they will be treated in the same way as anyone else losing their home under the provisions of the Homelessness legislation (Part VII Housing Act 1996, as amended). With the exception of those occupying Armed Forces tied accommodation (see section 17).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocations Plan and Social Care Groups</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quota Queues</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social Care Groups</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year Reading Borough Council will review the needs of those housed. This will inform quotas for different social care groups, meaning that individuals within these groups may be given additional priority. The number of individual quotas for each queue will be calculated on an annual basis. The awarding of this priority will be considered in consultation with social care groups or agencies. From time to time, it may also be necessary to restrict adverts to specific groups. This could be in circumstances where a specific group of applicants are experiencing acute housing difficulties or where there is a need to intervene to enable community cohesion in neighbourhoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The different community and quota queue groups are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Young people leaving</li><li>Young Persons. This may include teenage parents and 16/17 year olds. The Young Persons Housing Panel will determine which individuals are included in the</li><li>Single Homeless People. This may include rough sleepers where there are no specific support needs, and people moving on from the Homelessness Pathway. The Move On Options Panel determines which individuals are included in the quota.</li><li>People with Adult Social Care needs who need to leave supported accommodation to live more independently. This will include those accessing Mental Health Services, Learning and Physical Disabilities Services. The Adult Social Care/Housing Panel determines which individuals are included in the</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Right to Move Quota Queue</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year Reading Borough Council will review the needs of those social housing tenants who live outside of the borough and need to move to Reading to be nearer to work or to take up an offer of work. (see appendix 5). 1% of lettings will be offered to this group per year and the Council will manage this quota by restricting adverts to this group. An annual analysis will take place to determine the proportion of property sizes required to meet the needs of this group</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further quota queue groups may be identified based on housing need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In each case supporting information will be provided to the Voids and Lettings Team to enable assessment of a social care or quota queue case. This information will be provided by a supporting agency such as Adult Social Care, Children’s Services or a commissioned service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant’s band is elevated for the purpose of a quota queue, the housing situation will be reviewed every 3 months and any change of circumstances will be considered, which may result in the priority being removed. Applicants will be able to refuse 2 reasonable offers of accommodation (see section 24) and following this a direct offer will be made (see section 22)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though quota queues are in place, larger sized family units can be difficult to secure. This is because of limited social housing resources. It may be necessary to consider a range of options when considering these needs and this may include private rented accommodation under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (see section 26.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fostering and Adoption</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Children’s Social Care have a duty under section 22 of the Children Act 1989 to ensure sufficient accommodation to meet the needs of Looked After Children, as defined in that Act, in their area. Housing Needs will work together with Children’s Social Care to best meet the needs of prospective and approved foster carers and adopters. The Council will consider the circumstances of each individual to determine whether a move to alternative accommodation is required to facilitate adoption or fostering of a child to whom the Local Authority has a responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priority will be determined under welfare reasonable preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct Offers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A direct offer of accommodation is made when the Council selects a person for a vacant property rather than an applicant participating in Homechoice at Reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain circumstances Reading Borough Council may make direct offers to applicants. Examples of this are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People requiring accommodation on hospital discharge when they have no alternative housing to move to and the discharge is likely to be</li><li>Applicants that have been accepted for a Management Transfer who are not participating in the scheme despite suitable social housing vacancies arising or who have refused 2 reasonable offers of accommodation (see section 24). Homelessness applicants already placed in temporary accommodation by Reading Borough Council in a property that would otherwise be general needs permanent accommodation (permanent accommodation used as temporary accommodation) where this property is considered suitable as permanent accommodation it can be offered as</li><li>Homeless applicants who are not participating in Homechoice at Reading (see section 23).</li><li>Applicants where the Management Transfer Panel have agreed that they should remain in the property in circumstances where the tenant is no longer residing there. These cases will be assessed to show there is a clear need for the family to remain, if they have resided there for a significant period as their only and principal home, and if the property is suitable for their</li><li>Successful completion of a FIT (see section 1).</li><li>Reading Borough Council tenants whose behaviour is causing severe disruption to neighbours or to the household itself (see section 7).</li><li>Applicants considered as part of a quota queue who are not participating in Homechoice at Reading despite suitable social housing vacancies arising, or who have refused 2 offers of suitable accommodation (see section 24).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Decant and Regeneration schemes where the applicants are subject to notice under section 10 of the 1985 Housing Act and has been given the opportunity to participate within Homechoice but have failed to do so</li><li>Any other exceptional or mitigating</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council also reserves the right to make direct offers of accommodation outside the Choice Based Lettings scheme in certain circumstances. Examples include (but are not be limited to) those situations where the Council believes it is necessary to intervene on an estate to promote sustainability of an area or promote community cohesion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally only one direct offer will be made before sanctions will apply (see section 24).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homelessness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants owed the main homelessness duty by Reading Borough Council will be expected to actively participate with Homechoice at Reading. Assistance will be given to vulnerable households to help them to bid for accommodation. The Council will distinguish between those applicants who are participating in Homechoice at Reading and those who are not, and different sanctions will apply to both groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Those participating in the scheme</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants owed the main homelessness duty and who successfully bid for accommodation via Homechoice at Reading will only have the opportunity to refuse 1 reasonable offer of suitable accommodation, without incurring a penalty. If a homeless applicant refuses a second reasonable offer of suitable accommodation then the main homelessness duty will come to an end and no further offer of accommodation will be made to the applicant. The second offer will be considered to be the Final Offer under Part VII of 1996 Housing Act as amended. If at this time the applicant is in temporary accommodation they will be given a Notice to Quit, as the first stage towards gaining possession of the temporary accommodation. The applicant will then be considered to have No Priority for Housing for a period of 1 year (see section 18).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bids from homeless households will be reviewed every 4 weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Those not participating in the scheme</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>If homeless applicants choose not to participate in Homechoice by not making bids on accommodation which has been advertised and which is suitable for them, for example flats and maisonettes, or properties in particular areas, they will be made a direct offer (see section 22).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within 6 months of the homeless duty being accepted, if there have been suitable properties advertised and no bids have been placed the applicants will be made a direct offer. The offer will be made no sooner than 6 months after the homeless duty has been accepted, and as soon as a suitable property can be identified. If a direct offer is made, this will be considered to be a Final Offer under Part VII of 1996 Housing Act as amended. If the applicant accepts the direct offer the main homelessness duty will end. If the applicant refuses the direct offer the main homelessness duty will end and no further offers of accommodation will be made. If the applicant at this time is in temporary accommodation they will be given a Notice to Quit, as the first stage towards  gaining  possession  of  the  temporary  accommodation.       The applicant will then be considered to have No Priority for Housing for a period of 1 year (see section 18). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3> <strong>Right to Request a Review</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All applicants who are owed the main homelessness duty by Reading Borough Council will have a right to request a review of decisions regarding:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>suitability of the accommodation</li><li>the ending of their homelessness duty</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The request must be made in writing to the Voids and Lettings Team Leader within 21 days of the original decision (see section 24.3)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the applicant has chosen to move into the property offered and requests a review of the suitability of that accommodation, and the original decision is upheld, then they will be required to remain in the property as it will be deemed to be suitable. No further offers of accommodation will be made and the main homelessness duty will end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the original decision is not upheld, the property will be deemed not to be suitable and the applicant will be able to express an interest in other properties as soon as it is possible. In the meantime they will be expected to remain in the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refusals and Sanctions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In circumstances where an applicant refuses a suitable offer of accommodation Reading Borough Council will impose sanctions. This is to ensure that any delay does not have an adverse impact on others with a housing need that may want the same accommodation and to prevent property void time increasing (the time it takes to re-let properties).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refusal of suitable accommodation will be considered as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Failure to attend a viewing which if you had attended would have led to an offer of accommodation – unless good reasons are stated</li><li>Failure to complete a Registered Provider application form which, on completion, would have led to an offer of accommodation</li><li>Attending a viewing and then refusing the property without good reason</li><li>For certain groups e.g. homeless households, Management Transfers and quota queues, failure to participate in Homechoice at Reading, includes not bidding on properties that are advertised and that are suitable, or only placing bids on certain types of properties or certain</li><li>Refusal of a property offered as a direct</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sanctions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who have refused 3 suitable properties within a 6 month period will be removed from the Housing Register and cannot reapply for a period of 1 year from the date of the last refusal (see section 24).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where an applicant has been removed from the Housing Register and the applicant wishes to re-apply after the sanction period a new Homechoice Registration Form will be required to allow a new assessment of circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain groups may be limited to fewer refusals, for example, homeless households, Management Transfer, quota queues. For these groups the Council will consider placing them in the No Priority for Housing band for a period of 1 year (see section 18).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where an applicant has received a direct offer (see section 22) and subsequently refuses this, Reading Borough Council reserves the right to remove an applicant’s priority. When assessing the reasons for refusal, Reading Borough Council will have regard to the applicant’s circumstances and the reasons why the direct offer was made. Each case will be considered on its merits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Procedure for refusal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If an applicant refuses accommodation, including a direct offer of accommodation, officers will look at all the circumstances of the case to decide:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Whether the offer is suitable and reasonable, and</li><li>Whether the reasons given for refusal are reasonable</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will be contacted to arrange a viewing for a convenient time. If a viewing is arranged, but subsequently the applicant decides not to view the property, they must notify the Voids and Lettings Team within 24 hours of the viewing being arranged. The Voids and Lettings Team will discuss the reasons for not attending the viewing and will consider if this is a reasonable refusal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants who wish to refuse a property following a viewing must notify the Voids and Lettings Team within 24 hours. This is normally done by completing a Refusal form giving comprehensive reasons for their refusal. Where requested, the officer carrying out the accompanied viewing of the property will assist applicants to complete the form. This form must be returned to the Voids and Lettings Team within 24 hours of viewing the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council will notify the applicant in writing if their reason for refusing the property if considered a reasonable refusal or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Request for reviews</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants registering for social housing in the Borough will be provided with written decisions regarding their housing application along with details of the process to request a review of that decision. In the following circumstances applicants have the right to request a review:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The decision not to place an applicant on the Housing Register due to their eligibility</li><li>The decision not to place an applicant on the Housing Register due to the qualification criteria</li><li> Any decision about the facts of the applicant’s case which is likely to be, or has been taken into account, in considering whether to allocate housing accommodation</li><li>The removal of an application from the Housing Register</li><li>The suitability of a property which has been offered </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In circumstances where an applicant wishes to request a review of a decision, then such a request should be made in writing and addressed to the Council’s Voids and Lettings Team Leader. It should set out the reasons for requesting a review and should be made within 21 days of being notified of the decision in question. A senior officer, not involved in the original decision, will complete an investigation. The applicant will be notified of the decision of the review within eight weeks of the date from when they requested a review. If a longer period is needed, the applicant will be consulted about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants may be able to challenge some review decisions by way of judicial review via the County Courts. The Authority will recommend that the applicant seeks legal advice before taking these steps, or advice from the voluntary sector, such as the Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessibility and Supporting Vulnerable Customers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will receive support and assistance where necessary. Reading Borough Council will continue to work with statutory and voluntary organisations and to meet regularly to support vulnerable groups to access our service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All documents will be available upon request in a number of different languages and formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council will allow sufficient and support time for people with disabilities to engage in the Allocations process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Options including out of area</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reciprocal Arrangements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the Authority will only consider applicants that fall within the Allocations Scheme, although there will be times when Reading Borough Council will agree to assist another local authority or a Registered Provider on a reciprocal basis. This would normally be in an emergency situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All reciprocal arrangements are discretionary and the Council reserves the right to decline a request for a reciprocal transfer. All requests will be agreed in conjunction with the Assistant Housing Needs Manager and priority for a move will be in line with the Allocations Scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some circumstances, the Council may agree to accept two smaller units of accommodation in exchange for a larger property of the same number of bedrooms. The reciprocal authority or Registered Provider will be required to provide written</p>\n\n\n\n<p>commitment to the terms of the reciprocal arrangement. We will treat any agreed reciprocal applicant in line with our management transfer applicants (see section 17.7).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When agreeing any reciprocal transfer the Council would expect a replacement transfer within 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Applications to Move Out of Reading</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants will need to apply directly to the Local Authority that they wish to move to so that they can register to go on to their Housing Register. Any such application will be subject to the policies and procedures of that receiving Local Authority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rent Guarantee Scheme (RGS)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council promotes the RGS as an option for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness who are considered to have a vulnerability to allow them to access privately rented accommodation. Landlords joining the scheme offer good quality rented properties and let them through the RGS. Each property is checked prior to letting and vulnerable households are supported to enable them to sustain their accommodation. The RGS works by guaranteeing a deposit to the landlord and the tenant then contributes towards the deposit by making regular payments to Reading Borough Council over a period of up to three years. We will ensure that once saved the deposit will be protected for the tenants future use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On occasions, severely overcrowded secure tenants may consider the RGS as an option to alleviate their housing difficulties. This aspect of the Allocations Scheme will only be aimed at severely overcrowded households requiring 4+ bedrooms and will only be offered if it is deemed affordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mutual Exchanges</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Council or Registered Provider tenants can swap their homes providing their landlord has given permission.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Eligibility &#8211; the scheme is open to all secure Council tenants and Registered Provider tenants subject to the agreement of their</li><li>Applications &#8211; when two eligible tenants agree to exchange properties, they are each required to submit an application form to the Council’s Tenant Services. If one of the parties is a tenant from another landlord, then each will be required to submit an application to the other landlord. The housing officer will make a home visit and a decision will be communicated in writing to each party.

Examples of these include shared ownership, Help to Buy,&nbsp; New Buy schemes and Right to Buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These schemes change to reflect the prevailing climate and therefore details of current schemes available should be obtained from the Voids and Lettings Team on 0118 937 2172 or you may find details online. At time of print (September 2014) Radian Group is the Zone Agent in Berkshire for Help to Buy, <a href=\"http://www.helptobouysouth.co.uk/\">www.helptobouysouth.co.uk</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estate management</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sensitive Allocations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This element of the Council’s scheme addresses the imbalance between the demand for and supply of one-bedroom units for non-elderly households.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Council recognises that incompatibility may arise when mixing different age groups and it is accepted that a degree of sensitivity will be required when making such allocations to blocks designated for applicants over 50 years old. The housing officer&nbsp; will always consult with tenants in assessing the suitability of the applicant for age designated properties if they are below the set age requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not apply to Sheltered Housing schemes which will continue to be allocated to elderly applicants only.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Low Demand Properties</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of a strategy to keep the level of empty properties in the Council’s stock as low as possible and to minimise the time it takes to re-let a property that becomes empty (the ‘turnaround’ time), the Council must address the issue of ‘lower demand’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>properties. Low Demand properties are those that are difficult to let. In Reading the properties that have a lower demand generally fall into the following broad categories:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sheltered Accommodation (above ground floor or self-contained studio flat)</li><li>Age Designated 50+</li><li>Maisonettes and flats over shops</li><li>Properties in less ‘popular’ areas (or even specific roads)</li><li>Flats generally, but particularly high-rise</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where properties are deemed to be low demand, from time to time, initiatives may be put in place to increase the popularity of these properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Local Lettings Policies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Local Lettings policies have been developed to contribute towards community cohesion and sustainability within neighbourhoods. Local Lettings policies are usually implemented where there have been housing management issues, such as anti-social behaviour. The objective of Local Lettings policies is to enable the development of balanced and sustainable communities. Local Lettings policies will be developed in consultation with current tenants unless there are mitigating circumstances that require an urgent response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People applying for housing on estates where Local Lettings policies are in place may be subject to the terms of the specific policy, for example the undertaking of Police checks. The policies are reviewed annually with applicants/tenants and in partnership with the Police and local Councillors to ensure they are still relevant and necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Decants and Regeneration Scheme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to facilitate major repairs programmes or to accommodate tenants whose properties become uninhabitable (due to such incidents as a fire or flood) the Council operates a Decant policy. Whilst these major repair works are being carried out the Council has an obligation to re-house (temporarily) those tenants who are affected. In exceptional circumstances, a tenant who has a high priority for a transfer will be moved into permanent alternative accommodation in order to avoid two moves in a short space of time or where the regeneration scheme will not provide the size of accommodation required. Where a transfer applicant’s home is within a regeneration scheme and the applicant has been given the opportunity to participate within the scheme and has failed to do so, the authority will make a direct offer of accommodation (see section 22) See also the Decant factsheet for more information <a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/residents%E2%80%8C/housing/CouncilTenants/publications-advice-and-factsheets/factsheets-publications/\">www.reading.gov.uk/residents</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reading.gov.uk/residents%E2%80%8C/housing/CouncilTenants/publications-advice-and-factsheets/factsheets-publications/\">/housing/CouncilTenants/publications-advice-and-factsheets/factsheets-publications/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Succession</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Succession is when a surviving family member of a deceased tenant has the right under the Housing Act to take over the tenancy agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Section 86A Housing Act 1985 sets out those persons qualified to succeed the tenant as including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A tenant’s spouse, civil partner, common law spouse or common law civil partner</li><li>Another close family member of the tenant as prescribed by the local authority who has been residing with the tenant throughout the period of twelve months prior to the death of the</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Borough Council has prescribed the following who can claim to be a close family member of the tenant as including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Parent</li><li>Grandparent</li><li>Grandchild</li><li>Child</li><li>Brother</li><li>Sister</li><li>Uncle</li><li>Aunt</li><li>Nephew</li><li>Niece</li><li>(including relationships by marriage, civil partnership, step relationships and other children regardless of the marital status of the tenant)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where there is no right to a statutory succession the Council, in acting as a good landlord, may exercise its discretion to offer a new tenancy in certain circumstances (see section 17.7).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Assignment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An assignment occurs when a Council tenancy is passed from one person to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secure tenancies cannot be assigned except in the following circumstances as set out The Housing Act 1985 Section 91 (as amended):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An assignment by way of exchange.

Local housing authorities (housing authorities) are required to have regard to it in exercising their functions under Part 6 of the 1996 Act</li><li> It is in addition to the Guidance for Local Housing Authorities in England on the Allocation of Accommodation issued in June 2012 (‘the 2012 guidance’). </li><li> References to sections in this guidance are references to sections in the 1996 Act. </li><li> Housing authorities are encouraged to review their existing allocation policies and revise them, where appropriate, in the light of this guidance as soon as possible</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Purpose of the guidance</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The Government is committed to increasing mobility for social tenants to enable tenants to meet their aspirations, and to support them into work. We want to ensure that tenants are not prevented from taking up an employment opportunity because they cannot find a suitable place to live, recognising that long term unemployment is damaging for individuals and communities. That is why in the Autumn Statement 2013 we set out our intention to introduce a light to Move for social tenants who need to move to take up a job or live closer to employment or training</li><li> We’ve already taken some important steps in the right direction. <em>HomeSwap </em>Direct is helping social tenants search for a new home across the country. Through the Localism Act, we have given local authorities the freedom to make better use of the social housing stock by taking transferring tenants who are not in housing need out of the allocation legislation, allowing authorities to develop appropriate policies for transferring tenants, without the risk of challenge from those in greater need on the waiting list</li><li> The Government has also taken decisive steps to increase the supply of affordable housing. The current Affordable Homes Programme is on track to deliver 170,000 homes between 2011 and 2015 with £19.5 billion of public and private investment. A further £38 billion of public and private investment will help deliver another 275,000 new affordable homes between 2015 and 2020. </li><li> To give effect to the Right to Move we have introduced regulations to prevent local authorities applying a local connection test that could disadvantage tenants who need to move across local authority boundaries for work related reasons. This guidance is intended to assist local authorities to implement these regulations.</li><li> The Government has made clear that we expect social homes to go to people who genuinely need and deserve them. That is why the Localism Act has maintained the protection provided by the statutory reasonable preference criteria which ensure that priority for social housing continues to be given to those in the greatest housing need. </li><li> Another important aim of this guidance, therefore, is to assist local authorities to apply the allocation legislation to ensure that tenants who need to move within or across local authority boundaries are given appropriate priority under local authorities’ allocation schemes.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Qualification</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Section 160ZA(7) provides that local authorities may decide who does or does not qualify for an allocation of social housing, subject to any regulations made under subsection 8 which provides that the Secretary of State may prescribe that certain classes of persons are or are not qualifying persons, or that certain criteria cannot be taken into account in deciding who qualifies.</li><li> Subject to parliamentary scrutiny, the Allocation of Housing (Qualification Criteria for Right to Move) (England) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/967) (‘the qualification regulations 2015’) will come into force on 20 April. These provide that local authorities must not disqualify certain persons on the grounds that they do not have a local connection with the authority’s district. Specifically, a local connection may not be applied to existing social tenants seeking to transfer from another local authority district in England who: <ul><li> have reasonable preference under s.166(3)(e) because of a need to move to the local authority’s district to avoid hardship, and</li><li>need to move because the tenant works in the district, or</li><li>need to move to take up an offer of work </li></ul></li><li> This will ensure that existing tenants who are seeking to move between local authority areas in England in order to be closer to their work, or to take up an offer of work (hereafter referred to together as ‘work related reasons’), will not be disadvantaged.</li><li> We have made a similar provision for certain members of the Armed Forces community, by regulating to prevent local authorities from applying a local connection requirement to disqualify them1, in order to give effect to the Government’s commitment that those who serve in the Armed Forces are not disadvantaged in their access to social housing by the need to move from base to base. Aside from members of the Armed Forces and transferring   tenants who will benefit from the Right to Move, the Government has made clear that we expect local authorities to ensure that only long standing local residents, or those with a well established local association should qualify for social housing, and has issued statutory guidance to ensure that local authorities apply a residency test to social housing of at least two years. </li><li></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>1 The Allocation of Housing (Qualification Criteria for Armed Forces) (England) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1869)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 Providing Social Housing for Local People: Statutory guidance on social housing allocations for local authorities in England.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Local connection</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local connection is defined by s.199. A person has a local connection because of normal residence (current or previous) of their own choice, employment, family associations, or special</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Need to move</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The qualification regulations 2015 apply to transferring tenants who have reasonable preference under s.166A(3)(e), that is to say the local authority is satisfied that they need to move to a particular locality in the district of the housing authority, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or others).</li><li> The local authority must ensure, therefore, not simply that the tenant needs to movefor work, but that, if they were unable to do so, it would cause them hardship.</li><li> Local authorities must be satisfied that the tenant needs, rather than wishes, to move for work related reasons. In the Secretary of State’s view the factors that local authorities should take into account in determining whether a tenant needs to move to be closer to work or to take up a job offer include: <ul><li> the distance and/or time taken to travel between work and home</li><li>the availability and affordability of transport, taking into account level of earnings</li><li>the nature of the work and whether similar opportunities are available closer to home</li><li>other personal factors, such as medical conditions and child care, which would be affected if the tenant could not move</li><li>the length of the work contract</li><li>whether failure to move would result in the loss of an opportunity to improve their employment circumstances or prospects, for example, by taking up a better job, a promotion, or an apprenticeship </li></ul></li><li> This is not an exhaustive list and local authorities may wish to consider providing for other appropriate factors to take into account in the light of local circumstances. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Work</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The qualification regulations 2015 only apply if work is not short-term or marginal in nature, nor ancillary to work in another district. Voluntary work is also excluded.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Short-term</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In determining whether work is short-term, the Secretary of State considers that the following are relevant considerations:</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>whether work is regular or intermittent</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely to be particularly relevant in the case of the self-employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>the period of employment and whether or not work was intended to be short- term or long-term at the outset</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Secretary of State’s view a contract of employment that was intended to last for less than 12 months could be considered to be short-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Marginal</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The following considerations would be relevant in determining whether work is marginal:</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>the number of hours worked</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Secretary of State’s view employment of less than 16 hours a week could be considered to be marginal in nature. This is the threshold below which a person may be able to claim Income Support and the threshold for a single person’s entitlement to Working Tax Credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>the level of earnings</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities should take into account all the relevant factors when reaching a decision. The fact that a tenant only works 15 hours a week, for example, may not be determinative if they are able to demonstrate that the work is regular and the remuneration is</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ancillary</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Work must not be ancillary to work in another local authority’s district. This means that, if the person works occasionally in the local authority’s district, even if the pattern of work is regular, but their main place of work is in a different local authority’s district, the work is excluded from the ambit of these regulations.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A further relevant consideration would be whether the tenant is expected eventually to return to work in the original local authority district. If a local authority has reason to believe this is the case, they should seek verification from the tenant’s</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A person who seeks to move into a local authority to be closer to work in a neighbouring authority – for example, where the transport links are better in the first local authority’s area – is also excluded from these regulations. However, there is nothing to prevent local authorities looking sympathetically</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>on tenants seeking to move into their authority’s district for this reason, if they choose to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Voluntary work</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The regulations exclude voluntary work. Voluntary work means work where no payment is received or the only payment is in respect of any expenses reasonably</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apprenticeship</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The term ‘work’ includes an apprenticeship. This is because an apprenticeship normally takes place under an apprenticeship agreement which is an employment contract (specifically a contract of service).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Genuine intention to take up an offer of work</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Where the tenant has been offered a job and needs to move to take it up, they must be able to demonstrate to the local authority’s satisfaction that they have a genuine intention to take up the</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities may wish to ask to see a letter of acceptance and may wish to contact the employer to verify the position. Authorities may also wish to seek clarification from the tenant by interviewing them over the telephone or in</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Verification and evidence</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities will want to satisfy themselves that the work or job-offer is genuine and should seek appropriate documentary</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Appropriate evidence could include:</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>a contract of employment</li><li>wage/salary slips covering a certain period of time, or bank statements (this is likely to be particularly relevant in the case of zero-hours contracts)</li><li>tax and benefits information – eg proof that the applicant is in receipt of working tax credit (if eligible)</li><li>a formal offer letter</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Additionally, local authorities may wish to contact the employer to verify the</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Authorities are strongly advised to consider whether an applicant qualifies for an allocation under the qualification regulations 2015 both at the time of the initial application and when considering making an</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h1>Prioritisation</h1>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The qualification regulations will ensure that tenants who need to move between local authority districts for work related reasons are not disadvantaged by a local connection test. However, to deliver the Right to Move, it is also important that tenants who need to move for work, within or across local authority boundaries, are given appropriate priority under local authorities’ allocation schemes.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hardship reasonable preference</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Section 166A(3) provides that housing authorities must frame their allocation scheme to ensure that reasonable preference is given to people who need to move to a particular locality in the authority’s district, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or others).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Paragraph 4.11 of the 2012 guidance sets out the Secretary of State’s view that ‘hardship’ would include, for example, a person who needs to move to a different locality to take up a particular employment, education or training opportunity.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>This guidance goes further and strongly encourages all local authorities to apply the hardship reasonable preference category to tenants who are seeking to transfer and who need to move within the local authority district or from another local authority district to be closer to work, or to take up an offer of</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In considering whether a transferring tenant needs to move for work related reasons to avoid hardship to themselves (or others), they may wish to take account of the guidance set out in paragraphs 16 to 34</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Where a tenant is seeking to move within the same local authority district, local authorities are encouraged to take a more flexible approach. This is because the tenant is already accommodated in the district and any move to another social home will therefore be broadly stock neutral (that is to say the transfer creates another void which can be used to meet other housing needs). In particular, local authorities should consider whether or not the issue of whether work is short-term, marginal, ancillary or voluntary carries the same weight in relation to a within district</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Setting aside a proportion of lets for cross-boundary moves</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In framing their allocation scheme to determine their allocation priorities, local authorities will wish to strike a balance between the interests of transferring tenants who need to move into their district for work related reasons and the demand from other applicants in identified housing</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The Secretary of State considers that an appropriate way to do so would be for a local authority to set a quota for the proportion of properties that it expects to allocate each year to transferring tenants who need to move into</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>their district for work related reasons (‘the Right to Move quota’). The Secretary of State strongly encourages all local authorities to adopt such an approach and considers that an appropriate quota would be at least 1%.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities should publish the quota as part of their allocation scheme, together with their rationale for adopting the specific percentage. They should review and revise the proportion as appropriate, in the light of changing</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Local authorities may wish to set aside a higher proportion than 1%. Authorities that decide to set a quota that is lower than 1%, should be ready to explain publicly why they have chosen to do</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It is important that local authorities are open and accountable, to their own tenants and the wider community as well as to tenants seeking to move into the area for work related reasons. Accordingly, local authorities are encouraged to report locally on demand for and lettings outcomes in relation to the Right to Move</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Area based choice based lettings schemes</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>We consider that such schemes provide an excellent basis for cross- boundary mobility, particularly as housing and employment markets are likely to be similar across the partner authorities. Accordingly, we strongly encourage all local authorities that participate in area-based choice based lettings schemes to consider how they can provide for tenants to move between partner authorities for work related reasons, for example, by providing for a quota of lettings to be made available for this</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>We are aware that in some parts of the country, local authorities participate in area based choice based lettings schemes that bring together a number of authorities and Private Registered Providers of social housing, often with a common allocation policy that applies to all the partner local authorities.</li></ol>\n",

Usually if you are single and under the age of 35 you only qualify for the shared accommodation rate. However if you have been in care, this does not apply to you until you turn 22.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared accommodation £81.14/week or £351.61/month</li>\n<li>1 bedroom £153.02/week or £663.08/month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children’s Services are responsible for paying rent and providing other financial support to 16 and 17 year old care leavers until they are old enough to claim benefits .</p>\n<h2>Local connection</h2>\n<p>To qualify for help from Reading Borough Council you must have a local connection to Reading.</p>\n<p>You have a local connection if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are owed leaving care duties by Reading’s children’s services or</li>\n<li>you are a care leaver under the age of 21 and you are owed leaving care duties by another local authority and while you were in care you were placed outside their area and spent at least two years living in Reading including some time before you turned 16.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are unsure where your local connection is contact the Homeless Prevention Service.</p>\n<h2>If you become homeless after leaving care</h2>\n<p>The help you get depends upon your age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under 18 years: Children’s Services are responsible for finding you somewhere to live. They will carry out a joint assessment with the Homeless Prevention Service to look at your options.</li>\n<li>18 years to your 21st birthday: You can get support from both After Care Services and from the Homeless Prevention Service. If you were in care between the ages of 16 or 17 (even if you don’t qualify for after care services from a children’s services authority) we will assess you as being in priority need and provide you with emergency accommodation. If you are in full time education your After Care Service must find you somewhere to live during holidays (if you need<br />\nit).</li>\n<li>Over 21 years: We may offer emergency accommodation if we assess you as being in priority need. We will consider:\n<ul>\n<li>how long you were looked after, accommodated or fostered for</li>\n<li>whether or not you have had a stable home since you left care</li>\n<li>if you have slept on the streets in the past</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are between 18 and 24 years and you tell us that you are a care leaver we will contact the children’s services authority responsible for you as soon as possible – we need your consent for this.</p>\n<h3>Contact the Homeless Prevention Service</h3>\n<p>We are open Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm.

The revaluation will have effect from 1 April 2017, based on open market rental values from 1 April 2015.</p>\n<h3>What is revaluation?</h3>\n<p>The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) regularly reassess and update the rateable values of all business properties; usually every five years. This is called a Revaluation.</p>\n<p>A revaluation is done to maintain fairness in the system by redistributing the total amount payable in business rates and by reflecting changes in the property market. Revaluation does not raise extra revenue overall.</p>\n<p>For more information on the 2017 Revaluation, rateable values, and business rates visit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates\">https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates</a></p>\n<p>You can also estimate your business rates bill, including any small business rate relief that may apply.</p>\n<h2>Working from home or living above your place of work</h2>\n<p>If a property is used for both domestic and non-domestic purposes, we charge Council Tax and Business Rates. If you work from home, we may charge Business Rates for the part of the property you use for work. You will still have to pay Council Tax on the rest of the property. Please contact the Valuation Office Agency on 03000501501 or <a href=\"mailto:ratingsoutheast@voa.gsi.gov.uk\">ratingsoutheast@voa.gsi.gov.uk</a> for further information.</p>\n<h2>Reductions and Exemptions</h2>\n<h3>Exemptions</h3>\n<p>The following are exempt from Business Rates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agricultural land and buildings</li>\n<li>Fish farms</li>\n<li>Churches and places of worship</li>\n<li>Sewers</li>\n<li>Public parks</li>\n<li>Properties used for disabled people</li>\n<li>Moorings for boats</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reduced rates</h3>\n<p>Business rates could be reduced if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The property is empty or unused (exemption is granted for three months or six months if industrial)</li>\n<li>The property is occupied by a charity or non-profit organisation</li>\n<li>The property is partially occupied</li>\n<li>Hardship would occur is rates were not reduced</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think your rateable value is wrong or that your property should be exempt, download an appeal form from <a class=\" inlinelink id5660\" title=\"Rateable value of a business : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates\" rel=\"external noopener\">Valuation Office Agency website</a>.

Fans must be in place while all works take place above this level.</p>\n<p>2.15     300mm x 300mm baulk timbers will be required, for protection, to be set in the carriageway adjacent to the scaffold standards.</p>\n<p><strong>The following requirements are applicable where a minimum clearance from the kerb face cannot be provided.</strong></p>\n<p>2.16    Baulks to be painted red and white and rigidly fixed together and braced 100mm from the kerb face.</p>\n<p>2.17    Baulks to have red warning lights lit at all times and spaced at 3000mm intervals  (Minimum wattage 60 watt GLS or equivalent).</p>\n<p>2.18     Whenever baulk timbers are to be laid in the channel access to gullies and associated covers must be maintained.</p>\n<p>2.19     Where gaps are required in the outer scaffold corresponding gaps are to be made in the baulk timbers.</p>\n<h2>3. ERECTION OF SCAFFOLD</h2>\n<p>3.1     The erection of the first lift of any scaffolding is to be undertaken outside of peak hours between 9.30hrs and 15.30hrs Monday to Friday or at the discretion of the Head of Highways and Transport representative if the scaffold is to be erected on a classified road. N.B. These rules equally apply to the dismantling of scaffolding. During these times traffic flow should be maintained and no obstruction of the carriageway will be allowed, unless by that covered in 3.4.</p>\n<p>3.2     To prevent danger to contractors and the public, HSE Regulation 8 on falling objects states that suitable and sufficient steps must be taken to prevent the fall of any material or object from a scaffold. It also states that equipment must be stored safely to prevent danger arising from its collapse, overturning or unintentional movement.</p>\n<p>3.3     The first lift must be double boarded and contain a sheet between each layer of boards. Similarly all fans above the highway should be double boarded and sheeted.</p>\n<p>3.4     Above the first lift all scaffold must be handled directly from and to the lorry. If the lorry is parked on the highway, adequate traffic management should be erected, to the satisfaction of the Head of Highways and Transport representative. The traffic management shall ensure that delays to all road users, especially buses are kept to the minimum. If an articulated vehicle is used then the trailer must not be uncoupled from the tractor unit. Failure to provide adequate pedestrian and traffic management will result in suspension of the operations by the Head of Highways and Transport representative.</p>\n<p>3.5     No scaffold tubes, boards or associated fittings may be stored on the public footway or carriageway during erection or dismantling.</p>\n<p>3.6     Scaffold clips or any other scaffolding materials must not be thrown to or from the scaffold during erection or dismantling.</p>\n<p>3.7    Provision must be made for a safe pedestrian thoroughfare while the erection/dismantling of scaffolding takes place.</p>\n<p>3.8    All couplings below 2600mm shall be fixed so as to keep projecting threaded or clamp fixings on the opposite side to the main pedestrian route.</p>\n<p>3.9     All horizontal scaffold tubes below a height of 2600mm must be fitted with plastic end caps or otherwise made safe to the satisfaction of the Head of Highways and Transport representative.</p>\n<p>3.10     No scaffolding shall be attached to guard rails or any other street furniture.</p>\n<p>3.11    All protective sheeting and netting must be securely attached to the scaffolding, be able to withstand abnormal wind loads, and be maintained in a satisfactory condition.</p>\n<p>3.12    Whenever there is the possibility of street lighting being obscured or removed arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative for alternative lighting to be made (tel:0118 937 2113). A minimum notice of 28 days is required for the removal or adjustment of any light fittings. All costs will be borne by the scaffold licensee.</p>\n<p>3.14     Whenever there is the possibility of traffic signs, traffic signals or street name plates being obscured, or removed, arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative for alternative arrangements to be made. All costs will be borne by the scaffold licensee.</p>\n<p>3.15     Whenever there is a possibility of fire hydrants, utility covers, sewer entrances being obstructed arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative (tel. 0118 937 2454) to ensure that they are accessible at all times.</p>\n<p>3.16     In general, scaffold towers (mobile scaffolds and the like) will not be permitted on the public highway in the central area and on classified roads between 7am to 8pm, Monday to Saturday (excepting Bank Holidays) and 10am to 5pm on Sundays and Bank Holidays</p>\n<p>3.17     All scaffolding that is erected in the town is to be fit for its purpose and must comply with the requirements of the relevant legislation, including the following British Standards and Euro Code: BS5973, 1990 and July and August 1991; BS2482, 1981 and 1990; BS1139, pts 1 -5; EN39, 1976; BS5974, 1990 and July 1992; Construction (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1996; Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 1994, together with any subsequent amendments and/or additions.</p>\n<p>3.18    The requirements in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.17 equally apply for the removal of scaffolding from the Public Highway.</p>\n<h2>4. HOARDINGS</h2>\n<p>4.1     Hoardings shall be 2440mm high, rigidly constructed of smooth close-boarded timber. Other material may only be used if specifically approved by the Head of Highways and Transport representative.</p>\n<p>4.2     Hoardings shall be painted in a colour to be approved by the Head of Highways and Transport representative and kept in clean and safe condition.</p>\n<p>4.3     Hoardings must be lit at all times with bulkhead lights fixed to the top of the hoarding at 3000mm centres, red when facing the carriageway, white when facing the footway (Minimum wattage 60 watt GLS or equivalent). Lighting must be in place and operational within 7 days of the hoarding commencing.</p>\n<p>4.4     All access doors to be fixed so as not to open out over the footway.</p>\n<p>4.5     Whenever a scaffold is to remain in situ for more than 28 days the outside line of then scaffolding shall be boxed in with a 1200mm high hoarding. The top of this box must be covered and sloped at an angle of 45˚towards the carriageway. This requirement may be relaxed if the width of the footway is restricted.</p>\n<p>4.6    Whenever there is a possibility of fire hydrants, utility covers, sewer entrances, traffic control cabinets, traffic counters or any other street furniture being obstructed arrangements must be made with the Head of Highways and Transport representative (tel. 0118 937 2454), to ensure that they are accessible at all times.</p>\n<p>4.7    If it is permitted for a hoarding to enclose the footway then it should be set back a minimum of 450mm from the kerb edge. Should it not be possible to achieve this dimension then the requirements of paragraphs 2.15 to 2.19 would apply.</p>\n<p>4.8     All temporary footways are to be constructed with adequate cross falls and arrangements made to ensure that they do not affect the highway drainage if they extend into the carriageway. There shall be no steps and no ramp shall exceed a gradient of 1:15. The ramp will be surfaced with an approved non-slip material. Any ramp exceeding 1000mm in length or temporary footway extending outside the line of the hoarding or scaffolding shall have a suitably constructed timber handrail fixed to its outer edge. The handrail is to be painted white.</p>\n<p>4.9    If a footway is to be closed then requirements of Section 8, Temporary Road / Footway Closures must be adhered to.</p>\n<h2>5. STREET FURNITURE</h2>\n<p>5.1     Scaffold and/or hoarding must not obstruct access for servicing purposes to manhole chambers, cabinets and CCTV cameras. The view from existing CCTV cameras should also not be obscured by scaffolding and/or hoardings.</p>\n<p>5.2    Scaffold and/or hoarding must not obscure traffic signals lights to either vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Should such an obstruction to signals be unavoidable, in exceptional circumstances, and is agreed by the Head of Highways and Transport representative (tel. 0118 937 2620), the signals may be adapted temporarily, at the expense of the licensee.</p>\n<p>5.3     Where possible statutory signs, safety signs and direction signs must not be obscured. If any sign is obstructed the licensee will be required to supply a temporary replacement at his own expense, to be attached to the scaffold/ hoarding as agreed by the Head of Highways and Transport representative (tel. 0118 937 2454).</p>\n<p>5.4     If a street nameplate is obscured by scaffold/ hoarding the licensee will be required to supply a temporary replacement to be fixed to the scaffold/hoarding in a location agreed by the Head of Highways and Transport representative. Unless authorised by the Head of Highways and Transport representative, the Licensee must not tamper with or remove any street nameplate.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>A modern 8 lane 25 metre competition standard pool (including full diving facilities) will be built at the Rivermead site to replace Central Pool which will close at the end of this year. In east Reading, a new 25 metre community pool will be built in Palmer Park (linked to existing leisure facilities) and will replace Arthur Hill Pool.</p>\n<p>Arthur Hill Pool and Central Pool are ageing and expensive to run. They require major investment in order to bring them up to an acceptable standard. Both centres are now closed.</p>\n<p>The Council is instead choosing to team up with a leisure provider and invest in modern new sport facilities. We are in the process of identifying a delivery partner through a detailed procurement process, which is ongoing. We expect to be in a position to put in place a new leisure contract by Summer 2018 and that construction of both new pools will begin later in 2018.

The regency white stuccoed grade II listed mansion (now a restaurant) is set on a hill at the highest point of the park. The park has broad sweeps of short cut grass, with areas of meadow grassland. An pond was created to the south of the house and attracts an assortment of wildlife, while &#8216;The Rookery&#8217; can be found to the north &#8211; a mature oak woodland and Wildlife Heritage Site.</p>\n<p>A favourite amongst children is the mini steam train, run by voluntary enthusiasts on the first Sunday of each month, near the Bath Road entrance. The site also features a wide variety of sports facilities and a well-equipped children&#8217;s play area. The park is also host to a number of annual events including the Reading Carnival and a steam fair.</p>\n<p>There is a management plan for Prospect Park, details of which can be found in our downloadable <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Prospect_Park_Management_Plan-1.pdf\">Prospect Park Management Plan</a> and <a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Prospect_Park_Rookery_Management_Plan-1.pdf\">Prospect Park (Rookery) Management Plan</a> booklets.</p>\n",

A temporary bench has been installed by the new footpath at the south end of the playing fields. At the request of neighbours this bench will now be moved to further into the playing fields to avoid disturbance by persons in the late evenings. New benches will be installed along the new central footpath when it is installed next year.</p>\n<p>On the east side of the playing fields Agripower Ltd are continuing to strip and screen the topsoil of large stones and will be relaying the stone and then topsoil back onto this area to form a new playing surface. Agripower will also be forming the edges of the new playing area which will mean a small section of the heras fence moving very slightly to enable this part of the work to be done. In advance of this, Parks staff have removed some of the undergrowth along the fence line to keep pedestrian access open around the playing fields. The new soakaway has now been installed and once the screening and re-profiling works are complete the new drainage lines will be installed across this area during September and will include stone deliveries to back fill the drainage runs. We are looking to make these deliveries through the existing Mapledurham car park but this is dependent on Kier completing their works in the car park entrance road and the car park section to the playing fields. If their works are for some reason delayed then we will look to use the access route at the top of Hewett Avenue across footpath 43 for these deliveries until the car park entrance is available for access. This will mean the temporary closure of footpath 43 and a temporary traffic order on the bend of this road at those times when a delivery is made. We will look to keep these operations to a minimum.</p>\n<p>In September Agripower will also start to install the new play area as part of their works and this is to be located in the area at the north west of the site where their machinery is temporarily located. Neither the design nor location of play area is changed but it will be re-oriented (turned by 90<sup>0</sup>) to give more room between the football pitch to the west and the play area itself.</p>\n<p>We have been asked by neighbours about the orientation of the football pitches on the new playing area with possibly goal mouths backing onto neighbour&#8217;s gardens. Discussions are being held with Caversham Trent Football Club about this and they are taking a pragmatic approach to the orientation of the pitches and are listening to your concerns when they look at a layout of the pitches for the September 2020 football season.</p>\n<p>We have been asked when the pavilion refurbishment works will start. The actual construction work has been dependant on the £1.36m from the DfE which has now been received by the Trustees. In the interim a local architect has been appointed and initial design work started with community representatives. Detailed design work will now continue with a final design to be approved by Trustees. This work is dependent on all parties agreeing on the detailed pavilion design, planning approval and procuring a contractor within a short timeframe. If we receive the necessary approvals and have a contractor on board, we would look to start work in February 2020.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mapledurham_new_play_area_equipment.pdf\">Mapledurham new play area equipment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alpha.rbcweb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MPF_play_area_closure_notice.pdf\">MPF play area closure notice</a></p>\n<p>Reading Borough Council holds Mapledurham Playing Fields (MPF) in its capacity as charity trustee (&#8220;Trustee&#8221;) of the Charity. The Charity is registered with the Charity Commission.

A popular picnic site, the area features groups of mature trees and willow beds. However, the park is susceptible to flooding during the winter. The Coal woodland is at the eastern end of the Reading section of the Thames corridor, it is a wooded area raised out of the flood plain, and it starts immediately adjacent to the foot of Horseshoe Bridge at Kennet mouth. There is a towpath between the woodland and the river bank, and a small area of open space adjacent to the river which extends beyond the towpath and into the river. The woodland separates a Tesco superstore and car park from the river. In the northwest corner of the Kings Meadow is an old Victorian river-fed bathing station. Opposite this is an island and river lock, which is owned by the Environment Agency. The playing fields are used by football clubs throughout the season, although fixtures may be disrupted by flooding. In summer there is Gaelic football, and various events are staged throughout the year including Reading&#8217;s annual beer festival. Car parking is available in the south-west corner on Napier Road.</p>\n",

The gardens have recently undergone major restoration. They are located between the town centre and the ruins of the 11th century abbey, not far from Reading Station. The ornamental gardens have a wall around which provides a peaceful and tranquil retreat. There is a bandstand, and bands play every weekend in the summer. The Forbury Gardens is home to the famous Maiwand Lion statue. Although there are no formal children&#8217;s facilities, the gardens are wonderful for play, and the kiosk serves coffee, ice-creams and light lunches. The gardens have been entered for three national competitions, and have so far won a Green Flag Award every year since re-opening, along with annual accreditation as a Green Heritage Site, the BALI award and Best Regional Park in the Britain in Bloom competition.</p>\n",

The Holy Brook, which provided freshwater and power for the Abbey Mill, joins the canal at this point. Much of the waterside here is accessible. The history of the site is presented in the Story of Reading Gallery at nearby Reading Museum.</p>\n<p>The Ruins were fully conserved and interpreted in 2017-18 thanks to a £3.15m project supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund matched by a contribution from the Council. They reopen to the public on 16 June 2018. The Ruins host a wide variety of events including theatre, festivals and film, and are available for hire.</p>\n<p>You can find out more at: <a href=\"http://www.readingabbeyquarter.org.uk/\">www.readingabbeyquarter.org.uk</a>.</p>\n",

You will also need to book registrars to attend to conduct and register your wedding. Please note there is a fee for registrars to attend and register your wedding.</p>\n<h2>Music</h2>\n<p>The Register Office offers a range of classical music for weddings; however, you are welcome to bring your own music.

    "content": "<h2>1.0 Background</h2>\n<p>1.1 The Council has an overriding duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of the Cemeteries and Closed Churchyards for which it has responsibility, this includes the identification and control of hazards from unstable memorials.</p>\n<p>1.2 Through this policy and its actions the Council will seek to balance the risk of injury from unstable memorials with the sensitivities of carrying out works in the cemeteries and closed churchyards.</p>\n<p>1.3 This policy has been written having regard to the Special Report on &#8216;Memorial Safety in Local Authority Cemeteries&#8217; written by the Local Government Ombudsman published in March 2006 which gives advice and guidance to local authorities on this sensitive subject.</p>\n<h2>2.0 Risk Assessment, Inspection and Test</h2>\n<p>2.1 The council will risk assess and test memorials in accordance with the principles issued by the Institute of Cemeteries and Crematorium Management.</p>\n<p>2.2 All memorials will undergo a visual inspection. The inspection programme will be prioritised with attention directed at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Areas likely to contain significant numbers of unstable structures</li>\n<li>Crosses and larger structures which if unstable are likely to cause the most injury / damage</li>\n<li>Highly visited areas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.3 Memorials under 500mm will not undergo another test unless the visual inspection and positional risk assessment of the memorial gives rise to believe that further test is required, and it is considered safe to carry out a further test.</p>\n<p>2.4 Memorials over 500mm and up to 1.5m will undergo visual inspection, risk assessment and a hand test. A hand held testing device may be used when testing these memorials.</p>\n<p>2.5 Memorials above 1.5m will be visually inspected and risk assessed. If any further investigations are required they will be undertaken by a structural engineer.</p>\n<p>2.6 Records will be maintained relating to the inspection and consideration will be given to photographing the memorials.<br />\n2.7 Memorials will be subject to a re-inspection as part of a 5-year rolling programme.</p>\n<h2>3.0 Making Memorials Safe</h2>\n<p>3.1 Where an unstable memorial is identified the Council will either provide temporary support or place notices or if appropriate cordon the memorial. Cordoning is a temporary measure and will only happen in areas of the cemetery visited less frequently.</p>\n<p>3.2 Memorials will only be laid flat where this course of action is necessary to prevent a genuine hazard to health and safety that cannot be remedied or reduced to an acceptable level by temporary support or cordoning.</p>\n<p>3.3 If the memorial is to be repaired all works are to be carried out in accordance with the Council&#8217;s Memorial Safety Accreditation Scheme.</p>\n<h2>4.0 Action after Making Safe</h2>\n<p>4.1 The responsibility for maintaining a memorial in a safe condition is that of the grave owner. Where the grave owner cannot be traced and it is felt that the memorial has historic significance or its maintenance is important to preserve the character or ambience of the Cemetery, the Council will consider carrying out the repairs subject to funds being available.</p>\n<p>4.2 Where grave owners have been traced the options available to them will be discussed.</p>\n<p>4.3 Memorials, which have no historic significance, where the grave owner cannot be traced or family are not forth coming to resolve and where maintenance is not required to preserve the character or ambience of the cemetery, will be assessed and reviewed for further action. Further action may include digging a third of the stone into the ground, which is known as &#8216;socketing&#8217;, continued support, change to a monolith or respectfully laying the memorial flat within the grave space. This will be dependent on the location of the memorial within the cemetery and what is practical for the area and the safest option.</p>\n<h2>5.0 Provision of Information</h2>\n<p>5.1 The Council recognises that it is important to keep members of the public informed in advance of any memorial testing activity and will give public notice in advance of carrying out a general testing programme.</p>\n<p>5.2 Where records are available and considered to be in date the Council will notify individual grave owners that testing is to be carried out.</p>\n<p>5.3 The Council will notify individual grave owners, if known, when a memorial fails the test. The notification will detail what action the grave owner is required to organise and any action taken or proposed by the Council.</p>\n<p>5.4 Each memorial failing a test will have a notice placed on or near the memorial giving contact details and a period for contact.</p>\n<p>5.5 The Council will hold open days where the public will be invited and have the testing procedures explained and demonstrated.</p>\n<h2>6.0 Training</h2>\n<p>6.1 The Council will ensure that the Institute of Cemeteries and Crematorium Management or other suitable organisation will properly train all personnel carrying out testing.</p>\n",

Our policies and processes for infant cremation are aligned to the latest guidance on Infant Cremation, as per the advice of Lord Bonomy&#8217;s Infant Cremation Commission (June 2014 Scotland). Full statement here: <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/06/8342/3\">http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/06/8342/3</a></p>\n<p>In accordance with this guidance, which is fully supported by the national representative bodies (the Federation of Burial and Cremation Authorities (FBCA), the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management (ICCM), the Cremation Society of Great Britain (CSGB) and the Association of Private Crematoria and Cemeteries (APCC)) our ashes policy is set out below:</p>\n<h2>Definition of ashes</h2>\n<p>In line with Lord Bonomy&#8217;s proposals, the crematorium believes cremated remains and ashes to be one and the same thing. This supports the commission&#8217;s definition that ashes are &#8220;all that is left in the cremator at the end of the cremation process, and following the removal of any metal.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Return of ashes</h2>\n<p>Our approach to the cremation of babies and infants is designed to maximise the recovery of ashes. This includes using a cremation tray to hold the ashes where possible, and care to reduce the loss of any ashes during the cremation.</p>\n<p>We will employ best practice, for example the use of specialist computer programmes and metal trays. Our staff will watch out for any need to adjust cremation procedures in order to protect the ashes and maximise their retrieval.</p>\n<p>We are confident that the equipment and processes adopted for infant cremation at Reading Crematorium maximise the likelihood of recovering ashes. In any rare instance of non-recovery of ashes, we will conduct a review of the cremation process within 48 hours to understand why this is the case. The results of this review will be documented and contain details of any adjustments of our procedure deemed to be necessary, and will be available to next of kin/parent(s) if they wish to view these. We will adhere to our identification procedure that guarantees that the ashes resulting from individual cremations returned to parents are those of their baby.</p>\n<h2>Shared cremations</h2>\n<p>Where a shared cremation has been authorised, meaning ashes are not individually identifiable, we will take the same care throughout the cremation process. This will include steps to maximise the recovery of ashes. We will scatter/bury the ashes within the crematorium&#8217;s designated area. The location will be recorded for future reference.</p>\n<h2>Disposal of ashes</h2>\n<p>Concerning disposal of ashes after a private cremation, the crematorium will only act on the written instruction of the parent who is the Applicant for Cremation or another person nominated in writing by the parent.</p>\n<p>In the case of shared cremations we will only act on the written instruction of the designated person at the relevant hospital, who is acting as the Applicant.</p>\n<p>Ashes will be held at the crematorium for up to 10 weeks to await collection by representatives or instructions as to their disposal. Where no further instructions have been received within the four week period, a further fourteen days&#8217; notice will be given in writing to the applicant. Once the fortnight has gone by, a final letter will be sent telling the representative that the ashes will be scattered within the grounds of the crematorium in 30 days if no further instructions have been received.</p>\n<h2>Disposal of metals</h2>\n<p>The applicant should give consent for disposal of metals recovered from an individual cremation and the applicant will be provided with information on the options available.</p>\n<h2>Record-keeping</h2>\n<p>All cremations of babies and infants will be registered at the crematorium. The information contained in forms and certificates will be retained indefinitely (this may be in electronic form).</p>\n<p>If ashes are scattered or buried within the grounds of the crematorium the final resting place will be recorded. Where ashes are to be collected, the details of any person authorised by the applicant to remove/collect the ashes, and the date on which the ashes were collected will be recorded.</p>\n<p>The policy of this Cremation Authority is designed to give an audit trail from initial funeral instructions to the final disposal of ashes (whether by collection from the crematorium or by scattering or burial in the Gardens of Remembrance).</p>\n<h2>Questions or queries</h2>\n<p>If you have any questions or queries about the cremation of your baby, you can speak a member<br />\nof the crematorium team.</p>\n",

Both chapels are equipped with audio visual facilities allowing the personalisation of the service with selected music and or photographic tributes.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"memorialservice\"></a>Memorial service</h2>\n<p>A memorial service may be religious or non-religious and can take place any time after the funeral. It is separate from the funeral and provides a relaxed atmosphere where the departed can be remembered with fond words, music and anecdotes. There is no coffin or casket, however, you may bring the ashes in an urn or suitable container and make them the focus. A memorial service can be the perfect choice if people cannot attend the funeral in person allowing you flexibility in choosing a date when all can attend. Memorial services can be booked direct with the Crematorium (there is no need for a funeral director). Please make arrangements with a Minister of Religion or Celebrant to conduct the Memorial Service. Alternatively, family or friends may wish to say a few words at the service.</p>\n<p>Should you wish to arrange a memorial service, please <a href=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/article/11223/Contact-us\">contact the crematorium office</a>.</p>\n<h2>Visits to chapels</h2>\n<p>We welcome visitors to view the chapels but please telephone in advance to book an appointment. We do have services throughout the day but will try our best to accommodate you.</p>\n<h2>Multi-faith</h2>\n<p>Both chapels may be adapted for religious ceremonies of differing faiths or can be used as a civil space for non-denominational funerals.</p>\n<h2>Civil celebrants</h2>\n<p>A civil celebrant will deliver a celebration of life centred on the person who died. Any music can be played at a civil service; the celebrant can add religious readings and music if required. A period of reflection can be added to the service where a moment for private prayer can be taken.</p>\n<h2>Humanist service</h2>\n<p>Humanist services are non-religious and are more focused on life. A humanist service will not include hymns, prayers or anything religious.</p>\n<h2>Webcasting</h2>\n<p>Obitus Webcasts allow absent family members and friends the opportunity to be a part of the service, without being physically present. Both of our chapels have the cameras installed to capture the service, this is then streamed live via a secure private link and recorded. Family members can share the secure link and password with whomever they choose.</p>\n<p>The service will be available to view &#8216;on demand&#8217; for up to 28 days after the service has taken place. All streamed services are recorded and available to purchase on DVD, Blu Ray or USB stick after the service has taken place.</p>\n<p><a class=\" inlinelink id6369\" title=\"Obitus webcasting : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"http://www.obitus.com/\" rel=\"external noopener\">Obitus website</a></p>\n<h2>Visual tributes</h2>\n<p>Photographic tributes are the perfect way to remember the life and times of loved ones. Obitus can provide a number of different photo options to be shown during the service the perfect way to trigger happy memories. Options include a single photograph shown throughout the service, a simple slideshow with up to 25 photos either played on a loop throughout the service or a professional photo tribute set to music of your choosing.</p>\n<h2>Family supplied video checking</h2>\n<p>The checking and preparation of a video supplied by the family or third party, played once at a time of your choosing.

When transfers are needed these are carried out by contracted funeral directors who are suitably equipped and qualified to do so.</p>\n<p>Where police do not attend or a death is believed likely to be natural and/or expected, the deceased may be taken directly into the care of the family&#8217;s chosen funeral director. Should a later transfer to a mortuary be required, this will be arranged by the Coroner&#8217;s Office.</p>\n<h2>Initial inquiries</h2>\n<p>A Coroner&#8217;s Officer will initially contact the deceased&#8217;s registered GP in order to establish whether there is a medical cause of death. If the GP is able to provide a cause of death in their best believe and knowledge, they will issue an MCCD (Medical Certificate of Cause of Death). If the deceased has recently been admitted to hospital, then the Coroner&#8217;s Officer may also make contact with a treating doctor at the hospital to establish whether they may be able to issue a MCCD.</p>\n<p>If an MCCD is issued by a medical professional, the Coroner&#8217;s Office will authorise release of the deceased from the mortuary into the care of chosen funeral directors. Relatives can then register the death and proceed with funeral arrangements. There will be no further involvement from the Coroner&#8217;s Office.</p>\n<h2>Post mortems</h2>\n<p>If a cause of death cannot be established by a medical professional, the Coroner will authorise a post mortem examination. This examination will be carried out by a pathologist and it will take place at the hospital mortuary.</p>\n<h2>What happens after a post mortem?</h2>\n<p>A Coroner&#8217;s Officer will be in contact following the post mortem to advise on the cause of death.</p>\n<p>If the death is due to natural causes, the coroner will authorise release of the deceased. The coroner will also issue paperwork to the relevant register office. A family member will then be able to register the death and proceed with funeral arrangements. There will be no further involvement from the Coroner&#8217;s Office.</p>\n<p>If the cause of death is unnatural, there will need to be an inquest.</p>\n<h2>Inquests</h2>\n<p>Inquests are public hearings into the facts of someone&#8217;s passing. When an inquest is needed, the death cannot be registered at the register office. The Coroner&#8217;s Office will issue interim death certificates in this case, and these will enable families to start sorting out the deceased&#8217;s affairs. Families will be kept updated as to when the inquest will take place and will be invited to attend if they wish.</p>\n<h2>Will there be a delay in organising a funeral?</h2>\n<p>The Coroner&#8217;s Officer will advise when the deceased can be released to funeral directors. There should be no delay in organising a funeral. Once a post mortem has been carried out and any appropriate forms filled in, then the deceased can be released into the care of funeral directors.</p>\n<p>If there is going to be any delay in releasing the deceased, for instance when a death is due to any criminal proceedings, this will be made clear to family by the Coroner&#8217;s Officer.</p>\n<p><strong>More information can be found in the &#8216;Guide to Coroner Services&#8217;:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-coroner-services-and-coroner-investigations-a-short-guide\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-coroner-services-and-coroner-investigations-a-short-guide</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Between 12th June 2017 and 21st July 2017, we invited informal feedback, to consider making a Red Route along the bus route number 17. A Red Route is a &#8216;no stopping&#8217; restriction which has worked well on major bus routes in London for many years. The Red Routes keep key public transport moving and prevent delays for bus passengers and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>\n<p>The scope of the proposal was to consider a combination of double-red and single-red lines to largely mirror the existing yellow-line controls and create a corridor &#8216;no-stopping&#8217; restriction. Existing parking and loading bays along the route were to be maintained and additional facilities provided, where possible.</p>\n<p>Double red lines will mean no vehicles can stop at any time, including to load or unload. There are some exceptions, such as hackney carriages, private hire vehicles and blue badge holders, who are allowed to stop to let passengers in and out. Single red lines will mean that drivers will be able to stop or park in accordance with the signed restriction.</p>\n<p>The red route restrictions can be enforced by CCTV cameras, enabling efficient management of unwanted stopping movements that disrupt traffic flow and create obstacles and hazards for cyclists and pedestrians.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>In September 2017, our Traffic Management Sub-Committee gave approval for this to be implemented as a test Traffic Regulation Order, which will be divided into 3 sections &#8211; West, East and Central.</p>\n<p>Promoting the scheme on an experimental Order allows for flexibility with the scheme, as it enables minor changes to be made to the restrictions once they are in place &#8211; it therefore allows us to shape the restriction to best meet local needs.</p>\n<p>After the initial 6 months of the test, the Sub-Committee will be required to consider any objections received and to decide whether or not to continue with the scheme. The experimental order can last for a maximum of 18 months.</p>\n<p>&#8216;The Eastern Corridor is complete, the Western Section is now being implemented with the Town Centre to shortly follow.</p>\n<h2>Information and Feedback</h2>\n<p>This webpage contains a number of documents to assist in understanding of the scheme and the detail of the Red Route restrictions. Detailed plans of the scheme will be added as each section is implemented.</p>\n<p>The innovative nature of this restriction means that we will be reviewing feedback over a minimum period of 6 months, following opening of the route. Your views are important to us and we&#8217;d be grateful to receive your feedback and any suggestions that you may have for local alterations to the scheme.</p>\n<p>Should you wish to comment, support or object to the restrictions, please do so by writing to <a href=\"mailto:highway.objections@reading.gov.uk\">highway.objections@reading.gov.uk</a>. Please include &#8216;Red Route &#8211; East&#8217;, &#8216;Red Route &#8211; West&#8217; or &#8216;Red Route &#8211; Centre&#8217; in the email subject line and provide the reasons for any objections to the scheme.</p>\n<h2>Red Route dispensations</h2>\n<p><a class=\" inlinelink id6655\" title=\"Red Route dispensation : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://self.reading.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-4e2f199b-8002-4ae4-9d03-e1aa11ef8346/AF-Stage-16d4d3f1-691d-4cb8-a7bf-3c7ca9f15c12/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes\" rel=\"external noopener\">Apply for a Red Route dispensation permit</a>.</p>\n",

All aspects of the work is entirely the legal resposibility of the statutory undertaker and its contractors.</p>\n<p>Some requests by utility companies are of course easier to accommodate than others, depending in the nature of the work and its exact location.

It has a committed team of Shared Lives officers and carers who have been involved for several years.</p>\n<p>The scheme supports vulnerable adults by placing them with an approved &#8216;Shared Lives carer&#8217;, who takes them into their home, supports them and shares their everyday life with them. The support is flexible and the person is encouraged to live as independently as possible.</p>\n<p>We currently support adults with learning disabilities, older people, those with mental health needs and those with a physical disability.</p>\n<h2>Why carers are needed</h2>\n<p>Some adults may require support from others to take care of<br />\nthemselves and develop independent living skills because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>their family are no longer able to provide care and support in<br />\nthe family home</li>\n<li>the adult does not wish to continue living at home</li>\n<li>the adult wishes to leave residential accommodation</li>\n<li>the adult is no longer able to live independently</li>\n<li>there are risks of isolation and vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How Shared Lives works</h2>\n<p>The Shared Lives scheme works in a similar way to fostering. People are referred to the Shared Lives team at Reading Borough Council by social workers, voluntary organisations, GPs or self-refer.</p>\n<p>The Shared Lives team then proceed with a matching process, to match the user with a carer; this matching is by mutual agreement and both parties meet and choose one another, which helps to ensure the success of the scheme. The recruitment and matching of carers takes between three to five months; training is then completed by the carer.</p>\n<p>The person then moves in to the carer&#8217;s home, either full-time, part-time or for respite care. Whilst there, they share the home, community and family life with the carer and are supported to engage in activities to complement their care.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of the Shared Lives scheme</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared Lives consistently outperforms all other forms of regulated care in CQC inspections, at 96% good or excellent. The Reading Shared Lives service is currently rated &#8216;good&#8217;.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Shared Lives enables people to live life to the full in their community, without having to live alone or in a care home&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;People sometimes use a shared lives scheme as a way of learning the skills they need to live independently and to help them put down roots in the area or community before moving into a place of their own&#8221;</li>\n<li>Many participants of Shared Lives report of feeling settled, valued and like they belong for the first time in their lives. Many make more friends, get involved with activities and are able to go on holiday for the first time in their lives as a result of Shared Lives.</li>\n<li>Carers have said that the scheme is a life-enriching experience for them and immensely rewarding through the ability to make a difference to people&#8217;s lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Types of care</h2>\n<h3>Full-time carers</h3>\n<p>Our full-time carers welcome an adult who needs support into their home and families. They provide a stable home with the practical and emotional support the person needs to maximize their potential. This can include supporting them to develop independent living skills and take part in hobbies and social activities.</p>\n<p>Ideally you will have some experience of caring for adults and must be willing to make a long-term commitment. You must have a spare room.</p>\n<h3>Respite carers</h3>\n<p>Respite carers offer short term placements in their own home so you will need a spare room. It could be an overnight stay or a weekend, to the occasional week to enable full-time carers to take a break from their caring role. Sometimes respite carers take the person needing support on a short holiday.</p>\n<h3>Day support</h3>\n<p>If you do not have the space to have someone stay with you, you could help and support someone with activities such as shopping, going to the cinema, attending football matches or getting involved with the local community. It could be that you help them learn how to cook or manage their laundry.</p>\n<h2>Becoming a carer</h2>\n<p>Caring for an adult with support needs can be a very rewarding and yet challenging task. As a carer you would be expected to treat the person as a member of your own family, understand the particular difficulties they face and give them the support and care they need to help them be as independent as they possibly can. Being a carer could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing a home</li>\n<li>Being flexible</li>\n<li>Having patience</li>\n<li>Developing practical skills</li>\n<li>Encouraging social contact</li>\n<li>Building confidence</li>\n<li>Offering emotional support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Qualifications</h3>\n<p>You do not need a specific qualification when you apply to become a carer but you must be willing to work towards gaining a caring qualification (currently the Care Certifi cate, on induction). It is helpful if you have experience of being in a caring role, but this is not essential. It is more important that you have a caring attitude.</p>\n<h3>Training and development</h3>\n<p>As a Shared Lives Carer you will be expected to complete all mandatory training. This can be completed as class room based or online.</p>\n<p>If there is a change in the needs of the person you are supporting and you require training for this, the scheme will provide you with this training. You can discuss any training needs when your Shared Lives Officer visits.</p>\n<h3>Carers events</h3>\n<p>As part of the scheme’s registration, we hold two or three events each year that carers are required to attend. We occasionally invite speakers along to talk about subjects of particular interest to the group. These events are also opportunities to socialise and get to know other carers and for you to build on your support networks.</p>\n<h3>Financial support</h3>\n<p>You will be paid a fee for each adult you support. We can tell you current fees when you enquire or meet with a Shared Lives Officer. If you need special equipment for the adult you look after, this will be provided for you.</p>\n<h3>Your contract</h3>\n<p>Shared Lives carers are contracted on a self-employed basis. Full-time carers are paid a fixed amount for the care they provide. Respite and day support carers are paid based on sessions.</p>\n<h2>Support for carers</h2>\n<p>Our carers offer an essential service to adults who require support so it is important to us that you feel valued and supported when you take on this vital role. You won’t be on your own &#8211; you are part of a professional team working closely together to provide the care and support needed.</p>\n<p>The sort of support you can expect includes:</p>\n<h3>The Shared Lives Officer</h3>\n<p>The Shared Lives Officer is your main source of support. They will monitor the placement to make sure you are happy with how things are going and offer advice and support to help you deal with any issues that arise. They will carry out visits and reviews of the placement.</p>\n<p>You can contact the Shared Lives Scheme any time between office hours if you have anything you need or want to discuss.</p>\n<h3>Care manager</h3>\n<p>The person you support may have an allocated care manager you can make contact with, if not you can still contact the care management team if you have any concerns.</p>\n<h3>Out of hours/emergency duty team (EDT)</h3>\n<p>If you have any concerns outside of the Shared Lives Team’s normal working office hours then you can contact the EDT, who can offer you support and guidance.</p>\n<h2>Application process</h2>\n<h3>Home visits</h3>\n<p>We will visit you at home to discuss your application and get to know you. We will talk to you about your background, your way of life, your approach to adults with support needs. We will ask for three or four references and ask your permission to carry out checks which include health/GP references, DBS check and mortgage/rental landlord references.</p>\n<p>We will explain things you need to know and answer any questions. The Shared Lives Officer will write a report on your suitability as a carer to present to the Shared Lives Panel. You will have the opportunity to read the report.</p>\n<p>If at any stage during visits you feel that being a carer is not right for you please let us know. Equally if during our visits we have any concerns or worries, we will talk to you about them straight away.</p>\n<h3>Shared Lives Panel</h3>\n<p>The panel is made up of representatives from other local authorities, the private and voluntary sector and the NHS. The Shared Lives Officer will present their report and make recommendations to the panel. The panel will consider the information and make the decision about whether or not to accept you as a carer. If the Registered Manager does not agree with the<br />\npanel’s decision they are able to override the overall outcome.</p>\n<h2>Matching adults and carers</h2>\n<p>Once you are approved there may be a gap until an adult is matched with you. Once we find a match we can start the process with you.</p>\n<p>It is important that you get to know each other before either party makes a commitment. There is no set time for this – we always work at a pace that suits everyone involved and the type of care you have decided to offer.</p>\n<p>At the end of a trial period all parties have to decide if they want to go ahead with the placement.</p>\n<h3>Unsuccessful placements</h3>\n<p>Usually we know by the end of the trial period whether or not the match is going to be a success. Very occasionally placements don’t work – if either you or the adult in your care are not happy it is in everyone’s interest for us to make alternative arrangements. It is unusual for matches to fail – most are very successful. Carers often continue for many years because the role is so rewarding. Because a placement does not work out does not mean that we will not try to make another match with a different adult when someone is referred to the service. Sometimes it can take time to find a match.</p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\"><img class=\"positionnone  noborder\" title=\"image2\" src=\"https://www.reading.gov.uk/media/9865/image2/image/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"image2 \" /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"positionnone\">Could you be a Shared Lives carer?</span></p>\n<h2>Contact the Shared Lives team</h2>\n<p><a class=\" inlinelink id6823\" title=\"Shared Lives carer form : Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://reading-self.achieveservice.com/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-4b7f67dc-e17f-48f0-a8fe-6ca6c1f06687/AF-Stage-e9cce6ab-796c-4cbe-ae30-097f59b38096/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=/en&amp;cancelRedirectLink=/en\" rel=\"external noopener\">Online expression of interest form</a></p>\n<p>Telephone: 0118 937 3700</p>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:sharedlives@reading.gov.uk\">sharedlives@reading.gov.uk</a></p>\n",

In 2016 they announced that for the 3 years from 2017/18 to 2019/20 Councils would be allowed to increase this by up to 3% in any given year, but no more than 6% in total over those years. Reading Borough Council took the decision to increase the Adult Social Care Precept element of Council Tax by 3% in 2017/18 and 2018/19.  As a result, in 2019/20 the Adult Social Care Precept will increase by 0%.</p>\n<p>The Government has said that this precept must be shown as a separate charge on all council tax bills. The precept shown on the bills is for the precepts in 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19. There is no addition to the precept in 2019/20.</p>\n<h2>E-billing account troubleshooting</h2>\n<h3>&#8216;Invalid username / password supplied&#8217;</h3>\n<p>This means that the username and/or password entered does not match login details held on our database.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that your username and password are both case sensitive.

The council directly manages 5,608 of these properties and 1,285 in North Whitley are managed under contract by Affinity Housing.  The stock includes 375 blocks of flats.</p>\n<p>There are seven blocks over 18m high in Reading. There are three 14-storey blocks of flats in Wensley Road, Reading, (RG1 6ED), and four eight-storey blocks in Granville Road, Southcote (RG30 3QD), with a total of 427 flats in these 7 blocks &#8211; as detailed below.</p>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 280px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"Tower blocks\" width=\"591\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Block location</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No. of blocks</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Flats per block</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Height of blocks/storeys</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Wensley Rd</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>89</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>42 m high, 15 storey</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Granville Rd</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>40</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>22m high, 8 storey</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Cladding </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>No</strong>ne of these tower blocks use the same ACM (Aluminium Composite material) or plastic cladding that was used at Grenfell Tower.</p>\n<p>The cladding used in Reading&#8217;s tower blocks is external wall insulation with a cement render finish.</p>\n<p>None of our tower blocks use cladding panels. The Wensley Road tower blocks have external wall insulation and there are some areas that have cavities between the external insulation and the mainly concrete construction, but on the limited elevations where they do occur, fire breaks are in place to stop the spread of fire. None of the other flatted blocks have cavities.</p>\n<p>None of the blocks have undergone a refurbishment which would have included the use of cladding. Wensley Rd flats were constructed in 1960 in solid reinforced concrete (Wimpey No-fines)  and were externally insulated in the 1990&#8217;s. Granville Road flats were constructed in 1958 in solid reinforced concrete (Wimpey No fines) and were externally insulated in the late 1980&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>We have a good knowledge of our housing block construction types and have assessed the fire risk in respect of these.  The council would like to test all cladding materials to provide maximum safety assurance. The council has approached the BRE which is the body carrying out testing for the Government but the agency has stated that it is not currently prioritising testing of non-ACM panels.  </p>\n<h2>Fire escapes</h2>\n<p>There are two fire escapes fitted on each of the seven tower blocks in Reading.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fire safety measures</strong></h2>\n<p>The Coley high rise flats have fire exits at both ends of the blocks and have a call-point fire alarm system in communal areas which can be heard throughout the building when activated. The Granville Road flats each have two communal staircases accessed via external balconies. All flats have their own smoke alarms which sound internally. Communal doors and the front doors of all flats are standard fire doors with smoke seals and strips which swell when in contact with heat to seal the door completely. This prevents smoke and fire entering a property, or from spreading from a property for a period of time. If tenants find, between our inspections, any damage to any of these features they should report them as a matter of urgency to our Repairs Helpdesk who will arrange repairs as a priority.  </p>\n<h3>Sprinklers</h3>\n<p>Currently there are only sprinklers in the bin storage areas.</p>\n<h3>Fire risk assessments</h3>\n<p>In the light of the Grenfell Tower fire and to provide assurance to our tenants the council has carried out  Fire Risk Assessments in all blocks. These were completed in early July. Prior to this Fire Risk Assessments were last carried out as follows:           </p>\n<ul>\n<li>193 Wensley Rd  &#8211; 23/6/17</li>\n<li>203 Wensley Rd &#8211; 19/1/16</li>\n<li>205 Wensley Rd &#8211; 23/6/17</li>\n<li>28 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n<li>34 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n<li>38 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n<li>42 Granville Rd  &#8211; 29/8/16</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A fully qualified fire risk assessor is responsible for carrying out the assessments. They are a trained officer of the council.</p>\n<p>None of the risk assessments showed the high rise buildings to be at high risk from fire.</p>\n<h3><strong>Royal Berkshire Fire Service</strong></h3>\n<p>The council owns and manages 375 blocks of flats. Since 2009, the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service has audited circa 90 per cent of the council&#8217;s blocks of flats with communal areas and have not raised any significant issues.   Since the Grenfell Tower fire the Fire Service have visited and visually inspected all of the council&#8217;s high rise blocks. Once RBFRS have visited a building they will notify the owner/landlord of any issues noted which require action. They can issue a &#8216;deficiency notice&#8217; on a building and no notices have been served on the council in recent years.</p>\n<p>The council is working closely with RBFRS and we are sharing information in regard to our building stock.  We welcome inspections from the fire brigade on our high-rise blocks or other housing stock.

    "content": "<p>A private fostering arrangement is when a child (under the age of 16 years, or under 18 years if they are disabled) lives with, and is cared for by, someone who is not their parent or close relative for 28 days or more. The term &#8216;close relative&#8217; includes grandparents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, half-relatives, step parents and people related by marriage. It is usually a private arrangement between the child&#8217;s parents (or someone with parental responsibility for the child) and the carers, and without any initial involvement from Children&#8217;s Services. Private fostering arrangements can arise for many reasons, for example, schooling, health care, family breakdown, parents&#8217; antisocial work patterns and extended holidays.</p>\n<p>Local authorities have a legal duty to safeguard the health and welfare of children living in private fostering arrangements. For us to meet our statutory responsibilities for the child, we need to know that they are being privately fostered.</p>\n<h2>The law relating to private fostering</h2>\n<p>Private foster carers do not have parental responsibility but do provide a home and day-to-day care for the child. Overall responsibility for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of the child remains with the parent or guardian.</p>\n<p>Although these arrangements are private, the child&#8217;s parents, private foster carers and Children&#8217;s Services have some legal duties and responsibilities laid down by the <a class=\" inlinelink id6381\" title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/part/IX\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Children Act 1989</a>, the <a class=\" inlinelink id6382\" title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/31/part/5/crossheading/private-fostering\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Children Act 2004</a> and the <a class=\" inlinelink id6383\" title=\"Opens in a new browser window or tab\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1533/contents/made\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Children (Private Arrangements for Fostering) Regulations 2005</a>.</p>\n<h2>Role of parents (or person with parental responsibility for the child)</h2>\n<p>The parent or legal guardian of a child being privately fostered must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>advise the private foster carer&#8217;s local Children&#8217;s Services of the private fostering arrangement at least six weeks in advance or, if an arrangement is made in an emergency, within 48 hours, and at the end of the arrangement</li>\n<li>notify local Children&#8217;s Services within 48 hours when the care arrangements change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parents are responsible for ensuring that the arrangement is suitable for their child. They retain parental responsibility and continue to be involved in decisions about their child&#8217;s care and future.</p>\n<p>They must give the person they have chosen to look after their child as much information about the child as possible. They should make a formal agreement about essential aspects of care (for example, health, education, religious and cultural needs, discipline). This should be set down in writing.</p>\n<p>Contact Children&#8217;s Services on 0118 937 3641 to let us know about a private fostering arrangement.</p>\n<h2>Role of private foster carers</h2>\n<p>The private foster carer must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>advise their local Children&#8217;s Services of their intention to privately foster a child at least six weeks before the start of the arrangement or, if the child is placed in an emergency, within 48 hours of the arrangement</li>\n<li>notify the local Children&#8217;s Services within 48 hours when a child leaves their care and provide the name and address of the person now responsible for caring for the child</li>\n<li>allow a social worker to visit them and the child regularly, and to assess the home where the child is cared for is appropriate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Private foster carers provide the child with a home and day-to-day care. Care arrangements (for example, education, health, religious and cultural needs, discipline) should be agreed in writing with the parents before the arrangement starts.</p>\n<p>Contact Children&#8217;s Services on 0118 937 3641 to let us know about a private fostering arrangement.</p>\n<h2>Children&#8217;s Services</h2>\n<p>Local authorities have a duty to check that children living in private fostering arrangements are safe and well cared for.</p>\n<p>Reading Children&#8217;s Services&#8217; duties include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>checking the suitability of private foster carers and assessing the circumstances surrounding the arrangement</li>\n<li>making regular visits to the child in their private foster home to check on their welfare and monitor the overall standard of care provided &#8211; this includes listening to the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings</li>\n<li>ensuring that private foster carers get the advice and support they need to keep the child safe and well</li>\n<li>providing preventative and support services where appropriate</li>\n<li>continuing to provide support services to the child after the end of the private fostering arrangement, if they are needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Private foster carers do not have to be &#8216;approved&#8217; by Children&#8217;s Services but we do have legal powers to take action if we have serious concerns with a private fostering arrangement.

    "content": "<h2>The Reading SACRE</h2>\n<p>SACRE means &#8216;Standing Advisory Council [on] Religious Education&#8217;. In the 1944 Education Act, each local education authority was empowered to set up a SACRE, but not compelled to do so. However, in the 1988 Education Act the setting up of a SACRE was made compulsory.</p>\n<p>A SACRE is a part of local government and its principal function is to advise the local authority on matters related to Religious Education and Collective Worship in schools. All students in schools must receive religious education and all schools must provide a daily act of worship within a broadly Christian context.</p>\n<p>Each SACRE usually meets once each term to fulfil its statutory duties, which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>advise the local authority on matters related to the Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education</li>\n<li>advise on Collective Worship and how it can be performed</li>\n<li>publish an Annual Report to the local authority and the secretary of State for education on the activities of the SACRE</li>\n<li>the SACRE must hold meetings open to the public, so the dates, times and places should be published by the local authority</li>\n<li>minutes of each meeting must be recorded and published for public record</li>\n<li>consider appeals from schools wishing to modify the legal requirement for acts of Collective Worship being of a broadly Christian character, and to hear these appeals by means of a procedure called &#8216;Determination&#8217;. The SACRE decides the outcome of such appeals, whether to allow changes or decline the changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also &#8211;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The SACRE is responsible for providing the Agreed Local Syllabus for Religious Education, which is reviewed about once every five years. The Reading Agreed syllabus is produced in collaboration with the Pan-Berkshire SACRE Hub, originally instituted to provide the 2012-2017 R.E. Syllabus. This means that the Syllabus is agreed and shared by the six Berkshire local authorities through the work of the Hub, on which committee the six authorities are represented. The New Revised Statutory Berkshire R.E. Syllabus published in June/July 2018 for 2018-2023, is the most recent version of the Agreed syllabus.</li>\n<li>The SACRE provides CPD free of charge for the teachers of R.E. in the local authority. This is available to ALL teachers of Religious Education, in the Reading Borough through the termly Teachers&#8217; R.E. Network Meetings. Schools not under the domain of the local authority may be charged a reasonable fee for events of a special nature, e.g. an R.E. conference. The Network Meetings are free to ALL schools. <a href=\"https://discoveryschemeofwork.com/crossing-the-bridges/\">Download free teaching resources from the RE discovery scheme of work</a>.</li>\n<li>The SACRE must consider complaints made about the teaching of R.E. referred to the SACRE by the local authority</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How is the SACRE composed? It consists of four groups: A, B, C, and D, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group A:  Representatives of Christian Denominations other than the Church of England, together with representatives of other faiths reflecting the principal religions in the area</li>\n<li>Group B: Representatives of the Church of England</li>\n<li>Group C: Representatives of Teacher and Head Teacher Associations, Teachers of R.E. and others representing bodies concerned with religious education</li>\n<li>Group D: Members representing the local authority, usually elected councillors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Numbers in each group are determined by the Constitution of the SACRE. (Information is available from the local authority.) Meetings must have at least one member from each group present to be quorate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://democracy.reading.gov.uk/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=214\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE)</a></p>\n",

You should contact the school directly if you wish to appeal for any of the following schools:</p>\n<h3>Primary Schools</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All Saints Junior School</li>\n<li>Civitas Academy</li>\n<li>Green Park Village Academy</li>\n<li>Meadow Park Academy</li>\n<li>Ranikhet Academy</li>\n<li>St Anne&#8217;s Catholic Primary</li>\n<li>St Martin&#8217;s Catholic Primary</li>\n<li>St Mary &amp; All Saints CE Academy</li>\n<li>The Palmer Academy</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Secondary Schools</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>John Madejski Academy</li>\n<li>Prospect School</li>\n<li>Reading Girls&#8217; School</li>\n<li>UTC Reading</li>\n<li>The WREN School</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Appeal hearing</h2>\n<p>An Appeal Panel is made up of three people who are independent of the Local Authority and the school you are appealing for.</p>\n<p>You have the right to come to the appeal hearing and present your case, or someone can present your case on your behalf. It is important to attend if you can, but whether you attend or not, the Appeal Panel will carefully consider all the written information you submit. A representative of the school will be present at the appeal hearing. The Clerk to the Appeal Panel will also be present at the appeal hearing to give independent advice if required and to keep a record of what happens.</p>\n<p>You will be given 10 school days&#8217; notice of the date, time and location of the appeal hearing and will be sent a copy of the written information submitted by you and the school&#8217;s representative in advance of the appeal hearing.</p>\n<p>We try to make the appeal hearing as informal as possible. The school&#8217;s representative will explain the reasons why your child has not been offered a place at the school you applied for. You and the Appeal Panel will be able to ask questions on their case. You will then be given the chance to present your case in support of your appeal. The Appeal Panel will already have all the written information you have submitted. The Appeal Panel and the school&#8217;s representative can then ask you questions if they need any further information on your case. There will be a summing up stage where you and the school&#8217;s representative can put forward the main points of what you have said.</p>\n<h2>Appeal decision</h2>\n<p>You will be sent the Appeal Panel&#8217;s decision in writing, normally within five school days of the appeal hearing.</p>\n<p>Your appeal will be considered on its own merits. The decision making processes that Appeal Panels have to follow are explained in our School Admission Appeals Guide. There is a separate decision making process for appeals affected by infant class size legislation, which limits an infant class to 30 children.</p>\n<p>If your appeal is allowed, your child will be able to go to the school, and you can contact the school about taking up the place.</p>\n<p>There is no right of appeal against the Appeal Panel&#8217;s decision. If you feel the appeals procedure has not been carried out properly then you can contact the Clerk to the Appeal Panel for information on how you can complain about this.</p>\n<h2>2020-2021&nbsp;timetable of admission appeals</h2>\n<p>The appeals timetable sets out key dates of the appeals process.</p>\n<h3>For secondary school entry into Year 7 in September 2020</h3>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"Admission appeal timetable - secondary schools\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 2 March 2020</td>\n<td>Secondary national offer day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 30 March 2020</td>\n<td>Deadline for submitting appeals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 1 May 2020 to Friday 16 June 2020</td>\n<td>Appeals heard</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>For primary school entry into Reception in September 2020</h3>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table style=\"height: 114px;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"Admission appeal timetable - primary school\" width=\"576\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Thursday 16 April 2020</td>\n<td>Primary national offer day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 18 May 2020</td>\n<td>Deadline for submitting appeals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday 1 June 2020 to<br />\nFriday 17 July 2020</td>\n<td>Appeals heard</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Appeal timescales</h3>\n<div class=\"tableoverflow\">\n<table border=\"1\" summary=\"School admission appeals timetable\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Timescale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadline for submitting appeal</td>\n<td>20 school days from national offer day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Appeals submitted by the deadline</td>\n<td>Heard within 40 school days of the deadline for submitting appeals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Late appeals and appeals for in-year admission</td>\n<td>Heard within 30 school days of the appeal being submitted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parents informed of appeal date by letter</td>\n<td>At least 10 school days before appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Admission Authority to submit its information for appeal to the Clerk</td>\n<td>Approximately 2 weeks before appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circulation of paperwork for appeal to all parties by the Clerk</td>\n<td>Approximately 1 week before appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadline for parents to submit any additional information for appeal</td>\n<td>5 working days before the appeal hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decision letter sent</td>\n<td>Within 5 school days of decision being made (may take longer during May, June and July)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Please note that appeals are not held during school holidays.</p>\n",
